This is because the animal's blind spot is behind its head and it runs away from 'danger'. If it turns around it sees an object coming towards it. If it is one animal then a passenger can sometimes help move the animal off the road.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>If you come across a cow or sheep on the road in the dark, the best way to encourage it to move is to turn your lights off and move slowly towards it.

High-sided vehicles are more likely to tip over on sharp corners.</p>\\r\\n<p>NZTA has guidelines for whether a corner requires these signs, what size they should be and how far before the curve they should be situated.</p>\\r\\n<p>The signs are from 15-95kph in 10kph increments. This way you can tell between speed limit signs and advisory signs. Read more about <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/the-difference-between-speed-limits-and-suggested-speeds/\\\">speed limits vs advisory speeds here</a>. A 35kph sign covers the range 31-41kph.</p>\\r\\n<p>The figure is measured by driving a vehicle around the curve at a constant speed and measuring the lateral forces acting on the vehicle using a side thrust gauge. Two runs that yield the same result must be made for a sign to be adopted.</p>\\r\\n<p>The speed set for the curve is 15kph less than the 85th percentile curve approach speed for speed of 30-60kph, i.e. the speed at which the top 15% of traffic would approach the curve, i.e. the speed just before the traffic begins to slow down. Therefore if the sign says 15kph then the 85% percentile is travelling at 30kph. For speeds of 80-90kph the advisory speed is 25kph less. For 110-130kph the advisory speed is 35kph less. These speed guidelines were set in the 1990s and are now out-of-date because overall speeds are lower and vehicle capabilities are higher. Although this doesn't stop surprisingly frequent rollovers of heavy vehicles each year through misjudging the corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signs are placed at least 120m ahead of the curve in rural areas and 60m ahead of the curve in urban areas.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p><img style=\\\"float: left;\\\" src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/120px-New_Zealand_PW-25_75_kmh.svg_.png\\\" alt=\\\"75 advisory speed\\\" width=\\\"120\\\" height=\\\"80\\\" />Suggested or advisory speeds are always found ending in 5. They are almost always for cornering and are either in a yellow rectangle, or attached to chevrons.</p>\\r\\n<p>The speeds are set using a formula based on measured speed before the corner and not actually what vehicles are capable of. For example, as you approach a tight left hand bend it might be signposted 45kph. Drive the other way and it becomes a right-hand bend and might be signposted 45 to 65kph (depending on the angle, camber and visibility).</p>\\r\\n<p>This suggests a comfortable speed in dry weather, but not necessarily what an experienced driver would take the corner at. As a learner driver, it&rsquo;s advised to stick to these speeds until you understand whether your vehicle is capable of more, you have better judgement, and you know that particular road. Cornering is all about taking the right line, and taking the wrong line on a corner with an advisory speed could mean that you go off the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>If it is wet, exercise more caution, particularly if you see signs such as &lsquo;Slippery when wet&rsquo; on the approach to the corner.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/New_Zealand_Sign_Assembly_-_Road_Slippery_When_Wet.svg_.png\\\" alt=\\\"slippery when wet sign\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"119\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The sign below indicates that the priority route has a sharp right-hand turn with an advisory speed of 35kph.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/35kph-right-turn.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"329\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Because suggested speeds and regulatory speeds are always written differently and on different coloured signs, there&rsquo;s no chance of confusing them.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"35k-barrier-sign.gif\",\"audioName\":\"241.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"what-does-this-sign-mean31\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/signs/what-does-this-sign-mean9/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:44:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":819,\"title\":\"35 car parks on the left\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:44:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":820,\"title\":\"A corner in 35 metres\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:44:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":821,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"The recommended speed for this corner is 35kph\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:44:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":241,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

There are several types of cat&rsquo;s eyes used on the roads in New Zealand and they serve three&nbsp;purposes.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Visual lane marking</strong> &ndash; using white in the middle and red on the left edge means that road users can follow these to stay in the lane. Using yellow where there are yellow no overtaking lines add visual reinforcement to the rule.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Tactile lane marking</strong> &ndash; if you drive over the road studs, you can feel it through your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension and steering, therefore it&rsquo;s a tactile reminder that you are straying from your lane</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Special feature marking</strong> &ndash; fire hydrants are marked with blue road studs and, in some areas, culverts and drains are marked with green road studs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cat&rsquo;s eyes come in several different colours.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blue marks the location of a fire hydrant. Blue reflectors are installed on, or just to the left of the centreline of the roadway. They were first introduced in 2004. They are called retroreflective raised pavement markers or RRPMs. In other countries they are called road studs. While you might not notice them while you are driving around, they are useful for vehicles attending a fire because they can quickly locate a source of water.</li>\\r\\n<li>Green marks the location of a culvert</li>\\r\\n<li>Yellow marks the centre line when you are not allowed to pass, as in the image below, or the right edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n<li>White marks between lanes, and where you are permitted to pass</li>\\r\\n<li>Red marks the left edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1531\\\" src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/yellow-road-stud-cats-eye.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"yellow road stud cats eye\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"232\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On unlit rural roads the studs&nbsp;are in groups of four, one metre apart, with 10m between each group.

You must wait until the green light shows before you can proceed. A police officer's directions can overrule a red light. There is not a free left turn.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Green lights</h3>\\r\\n<p>A green light means you can go, as long as it's safe to do so.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Filter lights and arrows</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/go-left-red-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"red filter light to the left\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />Filter lights are arrows that point left, right or straight ahead. They give specific directions to the traffic and can be used when traffic needs to be held to allow pedestrians to cross, or in complex junctions where one or more lanes can be allowed to proceed independently of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Intersections which are busy, have fast-moving traffic, have two or more lanes in either direction or have restricted visibility are more likely to have a red turning arrow to prevent drivers from making ill-judged decisions. It also allows for right-turning traffic to definitely turn and, with the use of sensors in the road, means that the turn signal only needs to be activated when there are vehicles waiting if there is a dedicated right-turn lane or bay.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, in the traffic signal shown to the left, traffic can go straight ahead but must wait to turn left. This combination is often seen where pedestrians are crossing to the left.</p>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/stop-right-green-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"green filter light\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />This image shows a green filter light to the left.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit. Using the same logic the equation would be 1 second every 13.2kph at least for the amber lights we measured.</p>\\r\\n<p>Yellow traffic lights on faster streets may stay on longer because it takes longer for vehicles to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orange-traffic-light.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"amber, orange or yellow traffic light\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"438\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Traffic light phases</h3>\\r\\n<p>The traffic signal phase in New Zealand goes red, green, yellow, red. Some countries have a combined yellow+green phase or a rapidly flashing amber which can indicate that you can go on a pedestrian crossing as long as all pedestrians have finished crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Red and green traffic lights have variable phases, depending on the intersection. More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.</p>\\r\\n<p>Phases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road. Newer systems use cameras and are monitored by an operations centre.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Running the red light</h2>\\r\\n<p>Going through the red light is called red light running and is a cause of accidents.

We then occupy ourselves with deliberate distractions, like singing to the radio, or we find ways to copy as best we can with other distractions. Here&rsquo;s a list of common distractions you will almost certainly encounter when driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>A 2001 study found the following percentages of distractions amongst drivers. While cellphone does make an appearance on the list it was only cited in 1.5% of the cases &ndash; this will probably be much higher now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Specific Distraction: % of Drivers</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Outside person, object or event: 29.4</li>\\r\\n<li>Adjusting radio, cassette, CD: 11.4</li>\\r\\n<li>Other occupant in vehicle: 10.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Moving object in vehicle: 4.3</li>\\r\\n<li>Other device/object brought into vehicle: 2.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Adjusting vehicle/climate controls: 2.8</li>\\r\\n<li>Eating or drinking: 1.7</li>\\r\\n<li>Using/dialing cell phone: 1.5</li>\\r\\n<li>Smoking-related: 0.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Other distraction: 25.6</li>\\r\\n<li>Unknown distraction: 8.6</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>More recent statistics from a HealthDay Poll in November 2011 of 2800 American adults look like this:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 86% of drivers have admitted to eating or drinking while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 37% of drivers have texted while driving at least once, while 18% of drivers have said they have formed the habit of doing it often.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 41% of adult drivers have set or changed a&nbsp;GPS system&nbsp;while driving, and 21% do it &ldquo;more frequently.&rdquo;</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 36% of adult drivers have used a map as road guidance while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>At least 1 out of every 5 drivers has admitted to combing or styling their hair while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 14% of drivers have applied makeup while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 13% of adult drivers have browsed the Internet while driving</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Children</h2>\\r\\n<p>If you can keep the child distracted, you can keep the child from distracting you, but therein lays the challenge. Children have notoriously short attention spans, and always seem to be needing to stop to go to the toilet.</p>\\r\\n<p>It&rsquo;s better to have someone else in the car with you to take on the role of keeping the kids occupied. Or encourage them to go to sleep. If they are OK reading or using an iPad or similar, let them do that. There is some evidence that if you tell a child not to read because it will make them travel sick that you then create this behaviour in them. Begin by telling them it's OK to read, then take it easy in the corners so you don't throw them about too much.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Pets</h2>\\r\\n<p>A pet in the front seat has the potential to be a distraction. You should never ride with your dog or cat in your lap. They should be either in a proper pet enclosure (like a cat cage) or you can let them ride in the boot if you have a station wagon. Bear in mind that if you have to stop quickly, Fluffy will become a heavy, claw-equipped projectile in your car which could damage you and seriously injure or kill it. Pet stores sell various devices for restraining your pet in your car. Just remember to let your pet out frequently if you&rsquo;re on a long journey.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Vehicle entertainment, climate and navigation</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-28\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vw-golf-steering-wheel-buttons-300x187.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"vw-golf-steering-wheel-buttons\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"187\\\" />Listening to the radio itself doesn&rsquo;t provide much of a distraction but changing the channel is because it&rsquo;s likely you will have to take your eyes off the road. Newer cars come with buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to keep your hands on the wheel while adjusting the volume or channel, like in the Volkswagen Golf GTI steering wheel on the left. In an older car make sure you tune your presets before setting off then you don&rsquo;t need to play around with trying to find the right frequency.</p>\\r\\n<p>Satellite navigation systems can provide a similar distraction. If you want to enter a destination in, whether you have a built-in sat nav or an external third-party one either as a standalone unit or on your phone, get someone else in the car to do it, or pull over.</p>\\r\\n<p>Adjusting the climate control is another distraction that may cause you to take your eyes off the road.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Visual distractions</h2>\\r\\n<p>&lsquo;Road furniture&rsquo; is constantly vying for your attention. Road furniture (or street furniture in some countries) is the term that describes items such as fire hydrants, benches, road signs, traffic lights, streetlamps kerbstones and other items that form the road environment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Road signs are instructional, however, some European and Scandinavian towns have dramatically reduced the number of signs and have found that people drive more carefully and the accident rate drops. By reducing the signs, people pay more attention to the road and drive to the conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p>The other big distraction are advertising hoardings and billboards, from simple signs scrawled advertising garage sales through to large billboards for major brands. The whole purpose of these signs is to distract you.</p>\\r\\n<p>Governments are interested in reducing sign clutter and there are local bylaws that prevent some kinds of signs. The UK government has a PDF about reducing sign clutter that <a href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-sign-clutter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">you can find here</a> (if you&rsquo;re interested).</p>\\r\\n<h2>Food</h2>\\r\\n<p>Drive-through food &ndash; it can be dangerous. It&rsquo;s hot, you put it in your lap, and are we really designed to handle food and drive at the same time? Major culprits for causing accidents through distraction are hot fillings scalding the driver, or spilling liquids.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you know you will want to eat on the journey pack food and drink that is convenient to eat with one hand &ndash; i.e. food that doesn&rsquo;t need two hands to open or consume. Or, stop on the side of the road and take a break while eating as it&rsquo;s more refreshing for your body.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Phones</h2>\\r\\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s illegal in New Zealand to use a hand-held phone to make a call. It&rsquo;s also illegal to send or read a text message while driving. This doesn&rsquo;t stop the phone from being a distraction, though. Even if you are using a hands-free kit, talking on the phone makes you around 1.3 times more likely to crash. Texting makes you <a href=\\\"http://www.edgarsnyder.com/car-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">23 times more likely to crash</a>&nbsp;and texting while driving kills 11 teens per day in the USA.</p>\\r\\n<p>Being distracted is inevitable when driving. Many of these distractions won&rsquo;t result in any problems, but you do put yourself at increased risk of having a collision, or at least a close call.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"483.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"driving-distraction-blind-spot\",\"canonical\":\"resources/the-biggest-driving-distractions/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1733,\"title\":\"A hands-free phone call\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1734,\"title\":\"Being hungry\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1735,\"title\":\"Texting without looking at the phone\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1736,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Checking your blind spot\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":483,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

You must wait until the green light shows before you can proceed. A police officer's directions can overrule a red light. There is not a free left turn.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Green lights</h3>\\r\\n<p>A green light means you can go, as long as it's safe to do so.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Filter lights and arrows</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/go-left-red-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"red filter light to the left\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />Filter lights are arrows that point left, right or straight ahead. They give specific directions to the traffic and can be used when traffic needs to be held to allow pedestrians to cross, or in complex junctions where one or more lanes can be allowed to proceed independently of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Intersections which are busy, have fast-moving traffic, have two or more lanes in either direction or have restricted visibility are more likely to have a red turning arrow to prevent drivers from making ill-judged decisions. It also allows for right-turning traffic to definitely turn and, with the use of sensors in the road, means that the turn signal only needs to be activated when there are vehicles waiting if there is a dedicated right-turn lane or bay.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, in the traffic signal shown to the left, traffic can go straight ahead but must wait to turn left. This combination is often seen where pedestrians are crossing to the left.</p>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/stop-right-green-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"green filter light\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />This image shows a green filter light to the left. This is most frequently seen where two sets of facing traffic want to turn to the right. Both directions can turn right without interfering with each other's trajectories.</p>\\r\\n<p>The image below shows a red filter light and red light ahead.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/red-arrow-traffic-lights.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"362\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Yellow lights</h3>\\r\\n<p>This amber or yellow traffic light comes after a green light and indicates that the lights are just about to turn red.&nbsp;You should stop if it's safe to do so, and this will vary according to the road conditions, the braking ability of your car, and the ability for people behind you to stop.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Flashing yellow lights</h3>\\r\\n<p>If a traffic light is faulty it will flash yellow and you should apply the give way rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>The basic give way rules are:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Give way to vehicles coming straight ahead if you are turning</li>\\r\\n<li>Give way to vehicles turning left if you are turning right</li>\\r\\n<li>Give way to the right on roundabouts</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h3>Filter lights for specific vehicles</h3>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/special-traffic-signals.gif\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"117\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Buses, cycles and trams can be given permission to go first using one of the above priority&nbsp;lights when they are travelling in their own lane.</p>\\r\\n<h2>How long do traffic lights stay on?</h2>\\r\\n<p>The length of time that the yellow light displays depends on the speed of the intersection. A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit. Using the same logic the equation would be 1 second every 13.2kph at least for the amber lights we measured.</p>\\r\\n<p>Yellow traffic lights on faster streets may stay on longer because it takes longer for vehicles to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orange-traffic-light.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"amber, orange or yellow traffic light\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"438\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Traffic light phases</h3>\\r\\n<p>The traffic signal phase in New Zealand goes red, green, yellow, red. Some countries have a combined yellow+green phase or a rapidly flashing amber which can indicate that you can go on a pedestrian crossing as long as all pedestrians have finished crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Red and green traffic lights have variable phases, depending on the intersection. More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.</p>\\r\\n<p>Phases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road. Newer systems use cameras and are monitored by an operations centre.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Running the red light</h2>\\r\\n<p>Going through the red light is called red light running and is a cause of accidents.

They use sensors in the road to detect if a vehicle proceeds beyond the give way or stop line after the light has turned red. If you are already in the intersection when the lights turn red, then you won't trigger the camera.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/red-light-camera.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Red light camera in Auckland\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"561\\\" /></p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"green-arrow-right-traffic-light.gif\",\"audioName\":\"228.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"can-you-turn-left-when-you-have-this-tra\",\"canonical\":\"resources/traffic-lights-in-new-zealand/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":776,\"title\":\"Yes\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-10 09:01:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":777,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"No\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-10 09:01:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":228,\"correct_text\":\"You have a red light for straight through and left turning traffic.

Using yellow where there are yellow no overtaking lines add visual reinforcement to the rule.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Tactile lane marking</strong> &ndash; if you drive over the road studs, you can feel it through your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension and steering, therefore it&rsquo;s a tactile reminder that you are straying from your lane</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Special feature marking</strong> &ndash; fire hydrants are marked with blue road studs and, in some areas, culverts and drains are marked with green road studs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cat&rsquo;s eyes come in several different colours.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blue marks the location of a fire hydrant. Blue reflectors are installed on, or just to the left of the centreline of the roadway. They were first introduced in 2004.

You must wait until the green light shows before you can proceed. A police officer's directions can overrule a red light. There is not a free left turn.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Green lights</h3>\\r\\n<p>A green light means you can go, as long as it's safe to do so.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Filter lights and arrows</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/go-left-red-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"red filter light to the left\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />Filter lights are arrows that point left, right or straight ahead. They give specific directions to the traffic and can be used when traffic needs to be held to allow pedestrians to cross, or in complex junctions where one or more lanes can be allowed to proceed independently of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Intersections which are busy, have fast-moving traffic, have two or more lanes in either direction or have restricted visibility are more likely to have a red turning arrow to prevent drivers from making ill-judged decisions. It also allows for right-turning traffic to definitely turn and, with the use of sensors in the road, means that the turn signal only needs to be activated when there are vehicles waiting if there is a dedicated right-turn lane or bay.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, in the traffic signal shown to the left, traffic can go straight ahead but must wait to turn left. This combination is often seen where pedestrians are crossing to the left.</p>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/stop-right-green-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"green filter light\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />This image shows a green filter light to the left. This is most frequently seen where two sets of facing traffic want to turn to the right.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit. Using the same logic the equation would be 1 second every 13.2kph at least for the amber lights we measured.</p>\\r\\n<p>Yellow traffic lights on faster streets may stay on longer because it takes longer for vehicles to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orange-traffic-light.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"amber, orange or yellow traffic light\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"438\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Traffic light phases</h3>\\r\\n<p>The traffic signal phase in New Zealand goes red, green, yellow, red. Some countries have a combined yellow+green phase or a rapidly flashing amber which can indicate that you can go on a pedestrian crossing as long as all pedestrians have finished crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Red and green traffic lights have variable phases, depending on the intersection. More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.</p>\\r\\n<p>Phases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road. Newer systems use cameras and are monitored by an operations centre.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Running the red light</h2>\\r\\n<p>Going through the red light is called red light running and is a cause of accidents. Running the red light is dangerous.</p>\\r\\n<p>Pedestrians could&nbsp;start to cross and you risk hitting them - bear in mind pedestrians on the other side of the junction will be further across the crossing and therefore less likely to be able to avoid you</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicles may start to move, especially ones which are obscured from your view</p>\\r\\n<p>Road users run red lights sometimes deliberately, and sometimes accidentally:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Cyclists are frequent red light runners</li>\\r\\n<li>Changed or inconsistent phasing at intersections can lead regular users of the road to try to anticipate the change and get it wrong.</li>\\r\\n<li>Inconsistent phasing at adjacent intersections can cause confusion</li>\\r\\n<li>Poor visibility or conspicuity of the lights</li>\\r\\n<li>Low expectation of enforcement in that area leads to drivers taking risks</li>\\r\\n<li>Driver inattention</li>\\r\\n<li>Lights are obscured by a heavy vehicle turning in front of the driver</li>\\r\\n<li>Delays caused further back in the road have created lateness in drivers</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Traffic signals are installed and operated so that when everyone obeys the rule traffic flows more smoothly.</p>\\r\\n<p>The yellow light that precedes the red light displays for around 3.8-4 seconds in urban areas therefore you have plenty of time to stop before the intersection if you are not in a position where you would have passed through the intersection completely should you hold your speed steady.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not stopping at a red light is an offence and if you are caught you will be fined.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Red light cameras</h2>\\r\\n<p>Some intersections are covered by a red light camera such as the one pictured below. They use sensors in the road to detect if a vehicle proceeds beyond the give way or stop line after the light has turned red. If you are already in the intersection when the lights turn red, then you won't trigger the camera.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/red-light-camera.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Red light camera in Auckland\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"561\\\" /></p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"red-arrow-left-solid-green.gif\",\"audioName\":\"227.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"can-you-turn-right-when-you-have-this-tr\",\"canonical\":\"resources/traffic-lights-in-new-zealand/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":773,\"title\":\"No, there's a red arrow\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-10 08:59:05.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":774,\"title\":\"No, you can only go straight ahead\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-10 08:59:05.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":775,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Yes, but only if there are no vehicles coming\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-10 08:59:05.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":227,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

They will use traffic sounds, a change in the height of the pavement or kerb, and auditory warnings that beep at crossings.

They can also ask other pedestrians.</p>\\r\\n<p>If the intersection is new then blind pedestrians will need to interpret a number of tactile and auditory cues to determine the distance to cross, the direction of crossing, and whether there are islands.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don't move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Arrange loads so that they don't project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).</p>\\r\\n<p>Heavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a motorbike</h2>\\r\\n<p>Small loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.</p>\\r\\n<p>For lower loads, be careful that they won't touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>The load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don't hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.</p>\\r\\n<p>Distributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn't possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn't moved.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing a trailer using your motorbike</h3>\\r\\n<p>If you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a light trailer</h2>\\r\\n<p>Loads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It's preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn't possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.</p>\\r\\n<p>Goods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won't injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>Position the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don't want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball.

While they can sometimes miss very narrow objects like a metal pole, they are good at detecting larger objects.

If your car didn't come with a reversing camera you can install one yourself - check out the video below for an example with a big SUV.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Additionally, modern safety standards in cars have lead to the rear pillars being much thicker and the rear window being smaller than they used to be, which reduces visibility.

It is reversing already and the driver's view up the road will be obscured. The driver might be able to see you through vehicle A's windows, but imagine if this was a van or an SUV where the windows are at a different height. Therefore you should assume that the driver of vehicle B can't see you.</p>\\r\\n<p>If vehicle B has a reversing camera this might provide a view up the road. Also, new technology called <a href=\\\"https://mycardoeswhat.org/safety-features/rear-cross-traffic-alert/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Rear Cross Traffic Alert</a>&nbsp;is becoming more mainstream. This is where the reversing sensors scan up the road as the driver backs out. It's only really good for detecting slower moving vehicles such as bikes, though.</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicle C is unlikely to be a hazard unless you have to swerve around vehicle B if B backs out too far. Vehicle C could be a hazard if the car at D decides to reverse. However, the driver of D would easily be able to see C as there are no other vehicles blocking the view.</p>\\r\\n<p>D might equally decide to reverse out onto your side of the road, but as C is plainly visible this is unlikely. D could also obscure a pedestrian, but as the pedestrian has a clear view of C it's unlikely that they would cross in front of you.</p>\\r\\n<p>There is also a truck in the top left that is unmarked. As it is not indicating, we can assume that it won't move out from the kerb. If it was indicating then you would want to assume that it might not be able to see you because trucks have larger blind spots.</p>\\r\\n<p>So, in this case, you have two choices: you can stop and wait for B to reverse out of the space. This is safest for both of you.

If your reading is between 251-400mcg you will receive a $200 fine and 50 demerit points and will be banned from driving for 12 hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have a previous conviction then you will receive the licence suspension immediately you are above the limit.</p>\\r\\n<p>The suspension is for 28 days, and there are court-imposed penalties to add on the top.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Examples of fines and penalties</h2>\\r\\n<p>Killing or injuring someone while you&rsquo;re driving under the influence: up to 10 years in prison, up to $20,000 fine and one year or more disqualification from driving. If you&rsquo;ve already been convicted of a drink-driving offence, then your suspension will likely be more than one year.</p>\\r\\n<p>Driving while under the influence (i.e. more than 80mg/100ml): for a first or second offence you could receive up to 3 months in jail, a fine of up to $4500 and six months or more disqualification. If you have at least two previous convictions then you could face up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $6000, with a disqualification of at least one year.

As well as increasing your following distance to 4-5 seconds from the usual 2 seconds, it can help to use the air conditioning and the rear demister to keep windows clear. If water collects on your screen you can use the wipers but bear in mind that there might not be enough water to warrant using the wipers continuously.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are driving in rural areas there may be wildlife on the road. Some wildlife, e.g. deer, prefer to roam about in reduced visibility, and they won't be able to see you, either.</p>\\r\\n<p>If it's freezing, fog can freeze on the road and cause black ice.</p>\\r\\n<p>Use the left edge of the road as a guide. Pay attention to the lights of the vehicle in front, but don't tailgate.</p>\\r\\n<p>You must be able to <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/core/when-driving-at-night-on-a-road-with-lan/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">stop in the distance of clear road you see in front of you</a>&nbsp;if the road has lanes.

In the dark, there is no lighting on this road and there are plenty of corners, so the road markers help define the road&rsquo;s direction ahead.</p>\\r\\n<p>The markers themselves are plastic, flexible, high-gloss white strips that are designed to be durable enough to last 10 years. Because they are flexible they present a minimal hazard if they&rsquo;re hit by a vehicle. The red band is designed to be fade-resistant.</p>\\r\\n<p>The retroreflective strips in either white or yellow are applied with adhesive. The post itself is between 90-110mm and when they are inserted into the ground they are at least 800mm tall.

There are several types of cat&rsquo;s eyes used on the roads in New Zealand and they serve three&nbsp;purposes.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Visual lane marking</strong> &ndash; using white in the middle and red on the left edge means that road users can follow these to stay in the lane. Using yellow where there are yellow no overtaking lines add visual reinforcement to the rule.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Tactile lane marking</strong> &ndash; if you drive over the road studs, you can feel it through your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension and steering, therefore it&rsquo;s a tactile reminder that you are straying from your lane</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Special feature marking</strong> &ndash; fire hydrants are marked with blue road studs and, in some areas, culverts and drains are marked with green road studs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cat&rsquo;s eyes come in several different colours.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blue marks the location of a fire hydrant. Blue reflectors are installed on, or just to the left of the centreline of the roadway. They were first introduced in 2004. They are called retroreflective raised pavement markers or RRPMs. In other countries they are called road studs. While you might not notice them while you are driving around, they are useful for vehicles attending a fire because they can quickly locate a source of water.</li>\\r\\n<li>Green marks the location of a culvert</li>\\r\\n<li>Yellow marks the centre line when you are not allowed to pass, as in the image below, or the right edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n<li>White marks between lanes, and where you are permitted to pass</li>\\r\\n<li>Red marks the left edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1531\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/yellow-road-stud-cats-eye.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"yellow road stud cats eye\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"232\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On unlit rural roads the studs&nbsp;are in groups of four, one metre apart, with 10m between each group.

The roof rack manufacturer will specify the maximum load of the rack. You will also need to look for one that suits the shape and size of your vehicle. Not all vehicles can have roof racks fitted easily.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying loads on your roof rack your load must not extend more than 3 metres forward of the front edge of the front seat or four metres behind the rear axle.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don't move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Arrange loads so that they don't project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).</p>\\r\\n<p>Heavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a motorbike</h2>\\r\\n<p>Small loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.</p>\\r\\n<p>For lower loads, be careful that they won't touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>The load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don't hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.</p>\\r\\n<p>Distributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn't possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn't moved.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing a trailer using your motorbike</h3>\\r\\n<p>If you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a light trailer</h2>\\r\\n<p>Loads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It's preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn't possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.</p>\\r\\n<p>Goods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won't injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>Position the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don't want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don't want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.</p>\\r\\n<p>This video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.</p>\\r\\n<p><iframe src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZIuZ8BUhfew\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"350\\\"></iframe></p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing capacity</h3>\\r\\n<p>Your vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.</p>\\r\\n<p>For more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand/\\\">guide to towing loads</a>, or visit <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">NZTA's guide to safe towing</a>.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a heavy vehicle</h2>\\r\\n<p>Check out our main article about <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">carrying loads in heavy vehicles</a>&nbsp;as there are many more regulations.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"149-2.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"can-a-load-you-are-carrying-in-your-vehi\",\"canonical\":\"resources/carrying-loads-on-a-car-motorbike-or-trailer/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2020-05-14 09:38:34.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":547,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"No\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2020-05-14 09:38:34.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":548,\"title\":\"Yes\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2020-05-14 09:38:34.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":149,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

What must you do?\",\"description\":\"<h1>School crossings</h1>\\r\\n<p><strong>School crossings, which are also called kea crossings, are active in the hours when children are travelling to and from school, and occasionally at lunchtime.</strong> They are installed around school grounds for both management of children, and also to keep traffic flowing smoothly on busier roads. As they are controlled, the controllers will wait until a number of children have arrived before allowing the group to cross, rather than just have a pedestrian crossing with children crossing as they arrive, which holds up traffic more frequently.</p>\\r\\n<p>The stop signs provide an added safety feature to protect children that might just step into the crossing without waiting for vehicles to stop for them.</p>\\r\\n<p>As these crossings are sometimes almost exclusively used by school children, they are infrequently used through the day. Drivers who frequent the route can become used to there never being anyone on the crossing. The additional visibility and the signs make it easier for motorists to see and observe the rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>If there's no school patrol crossing then the road functions as a normal road. If the kea crossing commandeers a pedestrian crossing, then the pedestrian crossing returns to its normal function once the kea crossing flags and signs are removed.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What features does a kea crossing have?</h2>\\r\\n<p>A kea crossing will be marked 65m in advance by a permanent fluorescent orange <em>children crossing</em> sign. They are the same as those used outside schools warning motorists that pedestrians might be crossing ahead.</p>\\r\\n<p>Two types of removable signs are used at the crossing itself, but only while in operation. There are two fluorescent orange <em>children crossing</em> flag signs, and two red <em>school patrol</em> stop signs that swing out. These are removed when the crossing is not in operation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Just as with a pedestrian crossing you are not allowed to pass another vehicle waiting at the crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p>This diagram, courtesy of NZTA, shows a kea crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kea-crossing.gif\\\" alt=\\\"kea crossing\\\" width=\\\"412\\\" height=\\\"261\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Children crossing signs</h3>\\r\\n<p>In areas where children cross frequently you will often see fluorescent signs like the one below to warn you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img style=\\\"float: left;\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/120px-New_Zealand_PW-31.svg_.png\\\" alt=\\\"beware children crossing the road\\\" width=\\\"120\\\" height=\\\"120\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"78.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"you-are-coming-up-to-a-school-patrol-cro\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/you-are-coming-up-to-a-school-patrol-cro/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":287,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Stop until the signs are pulled back in\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:41:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":288,\"title\":\"Carry on if the children are not ready to cross\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:41:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":289,\"title\":\"Stop until the children have crossed\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:41:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":78,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

You must wait until the green light shows before you can proceed. A police officer's directions can overrule a red light.

They give specific directions to the traffic and can be used when traffic needs to be held to allow pedestrians to cross, or in complex junctions where one or more lanes can be allowed to proceed independently of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Intersections which are busy, have fast-moving traffic, have two or more lanes in either direction or have restricted visibility are more likely to have a red turning arrow to prevent drivers from making ill-judged decisions. It also allows for right-turning traffic to definitely turn and, with the use of sensors in the road, means that the turn signal only needs to be activated when there are vehicles waiting if there is a dedicated right-turn lane or bay.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, in the traffic signal shown to the left, traffic can go straight ahead but must wait to turn left. This combination is often seen where pedestrians are crossing to the left.</p>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/stop-right-green-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"green filter light\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />This image shows a green filter light to the left.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit. Using the same logic the equation would be 1 second every 13.2kph at least for the amber lights we measured.</p>\\r\\n<p>Yellow traffic lights on faster streets may stay on longer because it takes longer for vehicles to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orange-traffic-light.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"amber, orange or yellow traffic light\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"438\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Traffic light phases</h3>\\r\\n<p>The traffic signal phase in New Zealand goes red, green, yellow, red. Some countries have a combined yellow+green phase or a rapidly flashing amber which can indicate that you can go on a pedestrian crossing as long as all pedestrians have finished crossing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Red and green traffic lights have variable phases, depending on the intersection. More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.</p>\\r\\n<p>Phases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road. Newer systems use cameras and are monitored by an operations centre.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Running the red light</h2>\\r\\n<p>Going through the red light is called red light running and is a cause of accidents.

If your test reading is greater than 130mg per 100ml of blood or 650mcg per litre of breath you will receive an immediate on-the-spot licence suspension, as long as you have no prior convictions for operating or attempting to operate a vehicle while intoxicated (&ldquo;under the influence of excess breath alcohol&rdquo;), or for refusing to provide a sample, or for causing death or injury while driving under the influence. If your reading is between 251-400mcg you will receive a $200 fine and 50 demerit points and will be banned from driving for 12 hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have a previous conviction then you will receive the licence suspension immediately you are above the limit.</p>\\r\\n<p>The suspension is for 28 days, and there are court-imposed penalties to add on the top.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Examples of fines and penalties</h2>\\r\\n<p>Killing or injuring someone while you&rsquo;re driving under the influence: up to 10 years in prison, up to $20,000 fine and one year or more disqualification from driving.

Let's take a look at the hazards.</p>\\r\\n<p>In general, this is an intersection with good visibility. There's nothing on the pavement to hide pedestrians, and the road is clear with no islands or crossings. There's no signage shown that could be distracting.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Contrast it with the junction in this photo where there are vehicles waiting over the road in an intersection with poor visibility, a pedestrian waiting on the left, a deep shadow making it more difficult to see the Fiat on the right, and a roadworks sign. What you can't see in this photo is that there's a bus stop just around to the left, and a busy supermarket with many pedestrians crossing the road and waiting in the centre.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/stop-junction.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Complex staggered crossroads with shadows\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"367\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Back to our original intersection diagram:</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicle A is turning left onto the opposite side of the road and you are almost at the turning, therefore A does not cause a hazard.</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicle B is partially obscured by vehicle D, but is unlikely to manoeuvre to cause you any problems. The only problem vehicle B could cause is to hit D from behind. As D's wheels are already turned towards the driveway, this will shunt D into your path. This is a reason why when you are waiting to turn across a lane you should keep your wheels facing forward. It's better to be shunted into the back of a car in front than across into the path of traffic coming the other way.</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicle C would only be a hazard if it had to stop suddenly and there's no indication that that would happen in this diagram.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>However, the driver of D on the other side of the road, turning right into the driveway, may misjudge the distance between you and car C. You should be prepared to slow down or stop.</p>\\r\\n<p>Also, an advanced driver would notice that this is an older car - a Volkswagen Beetle. It's likely to have slower acceleration. It will almost certainly be a manual gearbox and therefore the driver could stall it half way through the turn.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>The other thing advanced drivers will look out for is the age of the driver of the other vehicle. Very young drivers are likely to be impetuous and lack skill in judging distances, whereas older drivers could have less visual acuity and perhaps slower reactions.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"hazard-turning-car.jpg\",\"audioName\":\"142.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"you-are-the-driver-of-the-blue-car-of-th3\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/you-are-the-driver-of-the-blue-car-of-th3/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":519,\"title\":\"The car turning left onto the other side of the road\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-05 19:31:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":520,\"title\":\"The car coming towards you\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-05 19:31:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":521,\"title\":\"The car you are following\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-05 19:31:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":522,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"The car on the other side of the road turning right\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-05 19:31:12.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":142,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

Using yellow where there are yellow no overtaking lines add visual reinforcement to the rule.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Tactile lane marking</strong> &ndash; if you drive over the road studs, you can feel it through your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension and steering, therefore it&rsquo;s a tactile reminder that you are straying from your lane</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Special feature marking</strong> &ndash; fire hydrants are marked with blue road studs and, in some areas, culverts and drains are marked with green road studs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cat&rsquo;s eyes come in several different colours.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blue marks the location of a fire hydrant. Blue reflectors are installed on, or just to the left of the centreline of the roadway. They were first introduced in 2004. They are called retroreflective raised pavement markers or RRPMs. In other countries they are called road studs. While you might not notice them while you are driving around, they are useful for vehicles attending a fire because they can quickly locate a source of water.</li>\\r\\n<li>Green marks the location of a culvert</li>\\r\\n<li>Yellow marks the centre line when you are not allowed to pass, as in the image below, or the right edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n<li>White marks between lanes, and where you are permitted to pass</li>\\r\\n<li>Red marks the left edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1531\\\" src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/yellow-road-stud-cats-eye.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"yellow road stud cats eye\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"232\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On unlit rural roads the studs&nbsp;are in groups of four, one metre apart, with 10m between each group.

Young riders that don't have a driving licence will be less aware of the dangers as they will not have learned how to manoeuvre in traffic and will have less conception about how long it can take a car or truck to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p>A rider will generally choose to ride on the verge, but if there is no verge &nbsp;and they are riding on the road you will need to give them even more room. A rider is not obligated to ride on the verge.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Horse and rider awareness</h2>\\r\\n<p>A horse will hear your vehicle approaching from the rear, but won't necessarily be able to see it, particularly if they have blinkers on. However, many modern cars (e.g. hybrids) are now very quiet and if there is a large amount of ambient noise such as high winds or farm machinery, the horse might not hear your vehicle until the last minute, which could startle it.</p>\\r\\n<p>A startled horse might lurch sideways into your path before the rider can regain control. A horse can easily weigh 500kg and the weight is carried high up, so if you hit a horse, the body of it will hit your windscreen causing a lot of damage. Motorcyclists are even more at risk.</p>\\r\\n<p>A horse rider might signal you to slow down by holding their arm out and moving their hand up and down. If they need you to stop they may show a raised hand. This might be because they are training an inexperienced horse in using the road.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Roundabouts</h2>\\r\\n<p>At a roundabout a horse rider will stay left the whole way around, even though they might be turning right. Watch for hand signals and give the horse and rider priority.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Speed limits around horses</h2>\\r\\n<p>There are no speed guidelines for overtaking a horse in New Zealand. The British Horse Society recommends 25kph, but if you have your stereo blaring then this could still frighten the horse, as can noisy blow-off valves or exhausts as you accelerate away. Once you are past the horse, accelerate gently away. Don't use your horn.</p>\\r\\n<p>A horse rider can take up a decent portion of a narrow country road, as you can see in the photo below.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/horse-rider-on-left-at-corner.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"horse and rider on a left hand bend in a narrow lane\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"390\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>If you were to come around this corner at speed, would you be able to stop? The Road Code says that on an unlaned road you must be able to stop in half the clear distance of road you can see in front of you.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>The photo below shows the ideal situation for overtaking a horse. The horse rider is riding as far left as is practical and, in this case, has actually stopped to wait for the car to overtake. The driver has moved as far right as possible on the road.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don't move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Arrange loads so that they don't project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).</p>\\r\\n<p>Heavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a motorbike</h2>\\r\\n<p>Small loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.</p>\\r\\n<p>For lower loads, be careful that they won't touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>The load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don't hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.</p>\\r\\n<p>Distributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn't possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn't moved.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing a trailer using your motorbike</h3>\\r\\n<p>If you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a light trailer</h2>\\r\\n<p>Loads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It's preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn't possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.</p>\\r\\n<p>Goods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won't injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>Position the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don't want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball.

This is because any forward momentum will be stopped by the seats.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you drive a hatchback, the safest place is to store them in the boot with the cargo blind/parcel shelf covering them. This will also constrain the items if you have to brake sharply.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you drive a station wagon or SUV, using the cargo blind in a similar way to the hatchback will help prevent items moving around.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you don't have a cargo blind, or you need to carry items that extend above the level of the seats, the safest way is to get a cargo net. Station wagons often come with fixtures to attach one that will prevent items from entering the passenger area.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have a few smaller items you can use an elasticated cargo net. Some vehicles come with one, such as this in an Audi S3.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/audi-s3-2014-cargo-net.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Audi S3 cargo net in the boot\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"473\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>Passengers carrying goods</h2>\\r\\n<p>In an accident, passengers will not be able to keep hold of anything they are holding because of the force. Also, any item on the back seats, or above the level of the back seats, will become a projectile moving forwards at the same speed that you were doing before you crashed. Heavier items can cause serious injury and even death. Extremely heavy items could pass through your windshield and then injure someone else.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying pets</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Cats</h3>\\r\\n<p>Most cats do not like travelling as they are taken out of their territory and feel vulnerable. While cats love exploring their own territory, the fear of the unknown is strong. It's extremely dangerous to have a cat loose in the car as cats do not take direction well and will either try to escape, or could become a distraction to the driver by climbing around.</p>\\r\\n<p>You need a good, solid pet cage with a waterproof base in case the cat urinates or becomes sick.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>It's best to have a cage with good air flow so that the cat does not overheat. Putting the cat in the boot of a hatchback is not a good idea as the sun could beat down through the rear window and there's very little airflow. A large cage is not necessarily better. Put the cage somewhere where it will be secure - if you can get the seat belt around the cage, do it; if you can block the cage with another piece of luggage, this is an alternative.</p>\\r\\n<p>Don't leave your cat in the car if the weather is hot. They can overheat in a matter of a few minutes.</p>\\r\\n<p>The cat will almost certainly be vocal initially, but should settle down eventually.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Dogs</h3>\\r\\n<p>Unlike cats, dogs see getting in the car as an adventure and like travelling. Dogs can overheat quickly in a hot car, just like cats. Make sure to bring water and a bowl if your journey is more than a couple of hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>Carrying your dog in a pet crate is the safest way. You can also put them in the boot if they are a larger dog, preferably with a cage like the one shown above to stop them from entering the passenger compartment. Again, watch for overheating if they are in the boot.</p>\\r\\n<p>Turn off power windows as it's easy for the dog to open them accidentally with the press of a paw.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Larger animals</h3>\\r\\n<p>While it's definitely possible to carry sheep and goats in a car, consider whether they would be better being in a cage trailer with good airflow. Horses and cows can be transported in a box trailer or horse float, again making sure that the animal's needs are cared for.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Smaller animals and birds</h3>\\r\\n<p>Small animals such as rodents and birds can be transported in a cage. Ensure the cage is secure and won't move forwards when braking.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"123.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"what-is-the-safest-way-to-carry-goods-in\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/what-is-the-safest-way-to-carry-goods-in/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-12 18:01:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":451,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"In the boot\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-12 18:01:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":452,\"title\":\"On the back seat\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-12 18:01:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":453,\"title\":\"Held by a passenger\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-12 18:01:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":454,\"title\":\"On your lap\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-12 18:01:09.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":123,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

Using yellow where there are yellow no overtaking lines add visual reinforcement to the rule.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Tactile lane marking</strong> &ndash; if you drive over the road studs, you can feel it through your vehicle&rsquo;s suspension and steering, therefore it&rsquo;s a tactile reminder that you are straying from your lane</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Special feature marking</strong> &ndash; fire hydrants are marked with blue road studs and, in some areas, culverts and drains are marked with green road studs.</p>\\r\\n<p>Cat&rsquo;s eyes come in several different colours.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Blue marks the location of a fire hydrant. Blue reflectors are installed on, or just to the left of the centreline of the roadway. They were first introduced in 2004. They are called retroreflective raised pavement markers or RRPMs. In other countries they are called road studs. While you might not notice them while you are driving around, they are useful for vehicles attending a fire because they can quickly locate a source of water.</li>\\r\\n<li>Green marks the location of a culvert</li>\\r\\n<li>Yellow marks the centre line when you are not allowed to pass, as in the image below, or the right edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n<li>White marks between lanes, and where you are permitted to pass</li>\\r\\n<li>Red marks the left edge of a motorway</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1531\\\" src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/yellow-road-stud-cats-eye.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"yellow road stud cats eye\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"232\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On unlit rural roads the studs&nbsp;are in groups of four, one metre apart, with 10m between each group.

We then occupy ourselves with deliberate distractions, like singing to the radio, or we find ways to&nbsp;copy&nbsp;as best we can with other distractions. Here&rsquo;s a list of common distractions you will almost certainly encounter when driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>A 2001 study found the following percentages of distractions amongst drivers. While cellphone does make an appearance on the list it was only cited in 1.5% of the cases &ndash; this will probably be much higher now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Specific Distraction: % of Drivers</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Outside person, object or event: 29.4</li>\\r\\n<li>Adjusting radio, cassette, CD: 11.4</li>\\r\\n<li>Other occupant&nbsp;in&nbsp;vehicle: 10.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Moving object in&nbsp;vehicle: 4.3</li>\\r\\n<li>Other device/object brought into&nbsp;vehicle: 2.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Adjusting vehicle/climate controls: 2.8</li>\\r\\n<li>Eating or drinking: 1.7</li>\\r\\n<li>Using/dialing&nbsp;cell phone: 1.5</li>\\r\\n<li>Smoking-related: 0.9</li>\\r\\n<li>Other distraction: 25.6</li>\\r\\n<li>Unknown distraction: 8.6</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>More recent statistics from a HealthDay Poll in November 2011 of 2800 American adults look like this:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 86% of drivers have admitted to eating or drinking while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 37% of drivers have texted while driving at least once, while 18% of drivers have said they have formed the habit of doing it often.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 41% of adult drivers have set or changed a&nbsp;GPS system&nbsp;while driving, and 21% do it &ldquo;more frequently.&rdquo;</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 36% of adult drivers have used a map as road guidance while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>At least 1 out of every 5 drivers has admitted to combing or styling their hair while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 14% of drivers have applied makeup while driving.</li>\\r\\n<li>Approximately 13% of adult drivers have browsed the Internet while driving</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Children</h2>\\r\\n<p>If you can keep the child distracted, you can keep the child from distracting you, but therein lays the challenge. Children have notoriously short attention spans, and always seem to be needing to stop to go to the toilet.</p>\\r\\n<p>It&rsquo;s better to have someone else in the car with you to take on the role of keeping the kids occupied. Or encourage them to go to sleep. If they are OK reading or using an iPad or similar, let them do that. There is some evidence that if you tell a child not to read because it will make them travel sick that you then create this behaviour in them. Begin by telling them it's OK to read, then take it easy in the corners so you don't throw them about too much.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Pets</h2>\\r\\n<p>A pet in the front seat has the potential to be a distraction. You should never ride with your dog or cat in your lap. They should be either in a proper pet enclosure (like a cat cage) or you can let them ride in the boot if you have a station wagon. Bear in mind that if you have to stop quickly, Fluffy will become a heavy, claw-equipped projectile in your car which could damage you and seriously injure or kill it. Pet stores sell various devices for restraining your pet in your car. Just remember to let your pet out frequently if you&rsquo;re on a long journey.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Vehicle entertainment, climate and navigation</h2>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align: left;\\\"><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-28\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vw-golf-steering-wheel-buttons-300x187.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"vw-golf-steering-wheel-buttons\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"187\\\" />Listening to the radio itself doesn&rsquo;t provide much of a distraction but changing the channel is because it&rsquo;s likely you will have to take your eyes off the road. Newer cars come with buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to keep your hands on the wheel while adjusting the volume or channel, like in the Volkswagen Golf GTI steering wheel on the left. In an older car make sure you tune your presets before setting off then you don&rsquo;t need to play around with trying to find the right frequency.</p>\\r\\n<p>Satellite navigation systems can provide a similar distraction. If you want to enter a destination in, whether you have a built-in sat nav or an external third-party one either as a standalone unit or on your phone, get someone else in the car to do it, or pull over.</p>\\r\\n<p>Adjusting the climate control is another distraction that may cause you to take your eyes off the road.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Visual distractions</h2>\\r\\n<p>&lsquo;Road furniture&rsquo; is constantly vying for your attention. Road furniture (or street furniture in some countries) is the term that describes items such as fire hydrants, benches, road signs, traffic lights, streetlamps kerbstones and other items that form the road environment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Road signs are instructional, however, some European and Scandinavian towns have dramatically reduced the number of signs and have found that people drive more carefully and the accident rate drops. By reducing the signs, people pay more attention to the road and drive to the conditions.</p>\\r\\n<p>The other big distraction&nbsp;are&nbsp;advertising hoardings and billboards, from simple&nbsp;signs&nbsp;scrawled advertising garage sales through to large billboards for major brands. The whole purpose of these signs is to distract you.</p>\\r\\n<p>Governments are interested in reducing sign clutter and there are local bylaws that prevent some kinds of signs. The UK government has a PDF about reducing sign clutter that&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reducing-sign-clutter\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">you can find here</a>&nbsp;(if you&rsquo;re interested).</p>\\r\\n<h2>Food</h2>\\r\\n<p>Drive-through food &ndash; it can be dangerous. It&rsquo;s hot, you put it in your lap, and are we really designed to handle food and drive at the same time? Major culprits for causing accidents through distraction are hot fillings scalding the driver, or spilling liquids.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you know you will want to eat on the journey pack food and drink that is convenient to eat with one hand &ndash; i.e. food that doesn&rsquo;t need two hands to open or consume. Or, stop on the side of the road and take a break while eating as it&rsquo;s more refreshing for your body.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Phones</h2>\\r\\n<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s illegal in New Zealand to use a hand-held phone to make a call. It&rsquo;s also illegal to send or read a text message while driving. This doesn&rsquo;t stop the phone from being a distraction, though. Even if you are using a hands-free kit, talking on the phone makes you around 1.3 times more likely to crash. Texting makes you&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http://www.edgarsnyder.com/car-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">23 times more likely to crash</a>&nbsp;and texting while driving kills 11 teens per day in the USA.</p>\\r\\n<p>Being distracted is inevitable when driving. Many of these distractions won&rsquo;t result in any problems, but you do put yourself at increased risk of having a collision, or at least a close call.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"482.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"driving-distraction-mirror\",\"canonical\":\"resources/the-biggest-driving-distractions/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1729,\"title\":\"Eating and drinking\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1730,\"title\":\"Being ill\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1731,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Looking in your mirrors\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1732,\"title\":\"Using a mobile phone\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2019-01-14 08:13:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":482,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

For example, if another vehicle is following you very closely be very careful about turning into driveways as it's easy for them to not be paying attention and run into the back of you. You can start slowing down more quickly to help them adjust their speed. As you turn, you can also glance in your rear view mirror to check there's nothing bearing down on you.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Check twice for bikes</h2>\\r\\n<p>You will check to your right and ahead, too. Always look at least twice because this gives you a much greater chance of seeing smaller road users like cyclists and scooters, especially when the light is poor.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>Queuing at an intersection</h2>\\r\\n<p>If you are waiting in a queue of traffic entering an intersection don't be fooled by a driver pulling away, thinking that you can go, too. Many minor nose-to-tail accidents happen when a driver moves forward and then quickly stops. The driver behind sees the driver ahead move forwards and also starts to move forwards. The following driver looks to the right and doesn't realise the driver ahead has now stopped and runs into the back of him.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Stop signs</h2>\\r\\n<p>Observe stop signs.

What's the best way of minimising the distraction?\",\"description\":\"<h1>Is it dangerous and distracting to listen to music in the car?</h1>\\r\\n<p>The car is where many people listen to the majority of their music, and our cars are becoming ever more connected. Some cars, like later model Holdens with MyLink, will interface directly with Pandora and Stitcher music apps so you can control them from the car's touchscreen. Then we've got streaming music via Bluetooth and the plethora of radio stations. Some cars come with USB inputs for memory sticks, an input for an SD card and even a local hard disk. If you don't have that, you can plug your headphones into your phone or MP3 player. All this choice for music means that your car is probably more powerful and fully featured than the stereo you have at home.</p>\\r\\n<p>But does music enhance your driving or distract from it?</p>\\r\\n<p>We've listened to music in cars for decades but do we know whether the&nbsp;type music has much effect? In accident statistics we know that 'changing the radio' is a common cause of accidents (and that includes fiddling with any type of controls, swapping discs or searching through MP3 files), but how many near misses are caused by us absentmindedly humming along to One Direction on the radio on a road with two directions, and how many are as a result of us deliberately choosing a specific type of music which changes our emotions and aggression?</p>\\r\\n<p>In 2013 a study by Brodsky and Slor assessed <a href=\\\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513002509\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">teen driver behaviour when listening to music</a> and its risk factors. 85 young novice drivers with an average age of 17, all of whom had passed their test within the last 7 months, completed six trips in an instrumented learners vehicle. All participants committed at least 3 driver deficiencies; 27 needed a verbal warning/command and 17 required a steering or braking intervention to prevent an accident. Deficiencies were things like speeding, failing to indicate, failing to check blind spots, tailgating, and so on.</p>\\r\\n<p>The big finding, though, was that if the music was selected by the driver it increased the mood and enjoyment of the drive but it also produced the most frequent severe driver miscalculations and inaccuracies, violations and aggressive driving. However, other music didn't necessarily have the same effect. The study used music on some trips that was structurally designed to generate moderate levels of perceptual complexity, and this music actually increased driver safety and improved behaviour!</p>\\r\\n<p>For journeys where the drivers got to choose the music, the most popular choice was dance/electronica. The drivers also had to complete a drive without music and with music supplied by the researchers.</p>\\r\\n<p>The choice of their own music appeared to increase the level of distraction.&nbsp;This could be because it made an emotional connection with the driver and it ceased to be a background noise. The music supplied by the researchers ended up being safer than no music at all.</p>\\r\\n<p>The study was only done on 85 drivers, all of which were novices, so we can't draw any inferences about behaviour in the general population. After only have driven a short time, the neural networks that make certain tasks automatic haven't formed that strongly with driving, and therefore the mental capacity needed to drive is quite possibly a higher percentage than for drivers that have 10 or 20 years of experience.</p>\\r\\n<p>Some people say that music helps keep them more alert on a longer journey - i.e. it prevents boredom.

Oversteer is most easily caused by too much power applied through the rear wheels, but most cars are now front-wheel drive which means the only type of oversteer there's a risk of is likely to be caused by braking or lifting off the throttle in the middle of a corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>Having different tyres can cause oversteer. For example, if the rear tyres are worn more than the front tyres, oversteer is more likely in wet weather because the rear tyres won't displace water as effectively from the road. If the rear tyres are a harder rubber compound than the front tyres, the front tyres will grip relatively well in relation to the rear tyres. Different tread patterns can also affect overall grip.</p>\\r\\n<p>Motorcyclists have to be more aware of oversteer as it can lead to a <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/highside-and-lowside-motorcycle-crashes-explained-video/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">highside or lowside crash</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>Heavy vehicle drivers don't usually have enough instantly available power to spin the rear wheels and cause oversteer. However, there are scenarios where it can occur. If the road is very slippery, the torque of the engine can overcome the grip available from the tyres. If there is a tail-heavy load the lateral g-forces can exceed the tyres' grip.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>In a heavy vehicle it's unlikely that the driver can catch the slide in time. Watch this dump truck experience snap oversteer which turns into an overcorrection which sends it the opposite direction.

Motorcyclists are allowed to do so as long as they do it safely. 'Safely' is an ambiguous term but it generally means that traffic should either be completely stopped (e.g. at traffic lights), or moving slowly (certainly no more than 40kph); the lanes must be wide enough to accommodate the bike and the vehicle; the motorbike must keep a sensible speed through the traffic (e.g. no more than 20kph faster than the vehicles being passed) This does mean that vehicle drivers should be aware of motorcyclists passing them on the left if they are in the right-hand or middle lanes.

They give specific directions to the traffic and can be used when traffic needs to be held to allow pedestrians to cross, or in complex junctions where one or more lanes can be allowed to proceed independently of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Intersections which are busy, have fast-moving traffic, have two or more lanes in either direction or have restricted visibility are more likely to have a red turning arrow to prevent drivers from making ill-judged decisions. It also allows for right-turning traffic to definitely turn and, with the use of sensors in the road, means that the turn signal only needs to be activated when there are vehicles waiting if there is a dedicated right-turn lane or bay.</p>\\r\\n<p>For example, in the traffic signal shown to the left, traffic can go straight ahead but must wait to turn left. This combination is often seen where pedestrians are crossing to the left.</p>\\r\\n<p><img style=\\\"float: left;\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/stop-right-green-arrow-light.gif\\\" alt=\\\"green filter light\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"110\\\" />This image shows a green filter light to the left.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit. Using the same logic the equation would be 1 second every 13.2kph at least for the amber lights we measured.</p>\\r\\n<p>Yellow traffic lights on faster streets may stay on longer because it takes longer for vehicles to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/orange-traffic-light.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"amber, orange or yellow traffic light\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"438\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h3>Traffic light phases</h3>\\r\\n<p>The traffic signal phase in New Zealand goes red, green, yellow, red. Some countries have a combined yellow+green phase or a rapidly flashing amber which can indicate that you can go on a pedestrian crossing as long as all pedestrians have finished crossing.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Red and green traffic lights have variable phases, depending on the intersection. More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Running the red light</h2>\\r\\n<p>Going through the red light is called red light running and is a cause of accidents. Running the red light is dangerous.</p>\\r\\n<p>Pedestrians could&nbsp;start to cross and you risk hitting them - bear in mind pedestrians on the other side of the junction will be further across the crossing and therefore less likely to be able to avoid you</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicles may start to move, especially ones which are obscured from your view</p>\\r\\n<p>Road users run red lights sometimes deliberately, and sometimes accidentally:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Cyclists are frequent red light runners</li>\\r\\n<li>Changed or inconsistent phasing at intersections can lead regular users of the road to try to anticipate the change and get it wrong.</li>\\r\\n<li>Inconsistent phasing at adjacent intersections can cause confusion</li>\\r\\n<li>Poor visibility or conspicuity of the lights</li>\\r\\n<li>Low expectation of enforcement in that area leads to drivers taking risks</li>\\r\\n<li>Driver inattention</li>\\r\\n<li>Lights are obscured by a heavy vehicle turning in front of the driver</li>\\r\\n<li>Delays caused further back in the road have created lateness in drivers</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Traffic signals are installed and operated so that when everyone obeys the rule traffic flows more smoothly.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>The yellow light that precedes the red light displays for around 3.8-4 seconds in urban areas therefore you have plenty of time to stop before the intersection if you are not in a position where you would have passed through the intersection completely should you hold your speed steady.</p>\\r\\n<p>Not stopping at a red light is an offence and if you are caught you will be fined.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Red light cameras</h2>\\r\\n<p>Some intersections are covered by a red light camera such as the one pictured below. They use sensors in the road to detect if a vehicle proceeds beyond the give way or stop line after the light has turned red.

There are still many gravel roads in New Zealand in rural areas, and even, as you can see in this case, not far from main cities.</p>\\r\\n<p>When gravel roads are wet, they don't provide problems with dust, but in the summer the dust can obscure other drivers' vision for several hundred metres behind you and, if you meet a vehicle coming towards you, its dust can be a problem for your visibility.</p>\\r\\n<p>Gravel roads still suffer from degradation, though. Gravel is lost over time through the road geometry (e.g. whether it's on an incline or flat), how good the drainage is (water washes away gravel), the type of gravel used, how frequently it is maintained, how much traffic passes over the gravel (gravel gets stuck in tyre treads and is taken away), and wind (wind can blow gravel if it's strong enough).</p>\\r\\n<p>If the road has flat areas, e.g. the crossfall (the gradient from the crown of the road to the edge) is less than 4%, water is likely to pool and weaken the road surface, causing potholes. Conversely, grades of more than 8% are discouraged because the road surface is not strong enough to withstand the acceleration forces of heavier vehicles. In this case, the incline might be sealed.</p>\\r\\n<p>What we might think of as gravel roads are actually three types of road:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Unformed roads - these are also called earth roads and have a natural alignment on the terrain without any engineering input</li>\\r\\n<li>Formed roads - these have a fairly well defined cross section with some thought to drainage</li>\\r\\n<li>Gravelled (or metalled) roads - these are built with specific engineering principals and are constructed with high quality gravel</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>When gravel is added back to the road it is called re-sheeting. When the road surface is scraped back to flat it is called grading and it's graded with a <a href=\\\"http://www.ritchiewiki.com/wiki/index.php/Motor_Grader\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">grader</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>Unsealed, gravel roads need to be designed considering the balance of:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>traffic volumes - i.e. the amount of traffic that will use the road</li>\\r\\n<li>road purpose - i.e. will it be heavy milk trucks, or just light vehicles</li>\\r\\n<li>terrain - how steep do the grades need to be</li>\\r\\n<li>budget for maintenance</li>\\r\\n<li>design standards.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Austroads (2003) suggests that an average daily traffic level of 150 vehicles or more justifies&nbsp;a single lane gravel road being formed as a two-lane gravel road.</p>\\r\\n<p>At intersections with sealed roads, the seal is usually extended to reduce the amount of gravel introduced onto the seal road, and to make turning off the sealed road onto the gravel road safer.</p>\\r\\n<p>For more information about <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/driving-in-low-visibility-situations/\\\">driving with limited visibility click here</a>.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":\"gravel-road-dusty.jpg\",\"audioName\":\"118.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"when-following-a-vehicle-on-a-dusty-meta\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/when-following-a-vehicle-on-a-dusty-meta/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":434,\"title\":\"Try to overtake\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-09 23:30:31.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":435,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Drop back so you're not in the dust cloud\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-09 23:30:31.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":436,\"title\":\"Put your lights on full beam so the other driver pulls over\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-09 23:30:31.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":437,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Put your lights on low beam if visibility is reduced significantly\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-09 23:30:31.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":438,\"title\":\"Drive down the centre of the road\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-04-09 23:30:31.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":118,\"correct_text\":\"Slowing down so you're not blinded by the dust cloud is the thing to do.

In the holiday season queues can form at these bridges on some roads.</p>\\r\\n<p>Edge lines form a taper to the bridge from the edges of the seal to the bridge carriageway width. This taper is ideally 50m long. Usually the lines stop when they reach the kerb of the bridge, painted in by about 300mm, unless there's sufficient room to effectively mark and maintain the lines (this is not as probable as the bridge already has restricted width, which is what it's a one-lane bridge).</p>\\r\\n<p>If the approaching roads have a centre line, this is marked up to the bridge, but not on the bridge itself. It's marked to a point where the width of the approach road narrows to less than 5m.</p>\\r\\n<p>There will be a give way line painted on the road with a white triangle. This doesn't have any legal significance, it's not compulsory you stop on the line or even behind the line, it's just a guideline. The give way line will be marked where the road is still at least 5m wide, and preferably 6m.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signs are placed at or before the line.</p>\\r\\n<p>The words ONE LANE BRIDGE are marked on the road. The distance of these from the bridge depends on the speed and type of road. In rural areas they must be at least 120m before the bridge, and in urban areas at least 60m before. The whole phrase is spread over 50m on the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>A single lane arrow can be used to remind drivers to stay on the left as they exit the bridge.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"one-lane-bridge-signs.jpg\",\"audioName\":\"102.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"you-are-coming-up-to-a-one-lane-bridge-a\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/when-coming-up-to-a-one-lane-bridge-what/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":376,\"title\":\"Stop.

In Europe and other countries that adhere to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be fitted with rear fog lights at minimum. They are less common on Japanese and American vehicles.</p>\\r\\n<p>The intensity of a rear fog lamp is similar to that of a brake light, or stop lamp, and for this reason there is an argument that having two fog lamps is confusing to drivers following because it looks like activated brake lights. Some cars, such as many Peugeot models, have a centre-mounted fog lamp. Many older cars have one single fog lamp in the right-hand rear light with a reversing lamp in the corresponding place in the left-hand light. Newer cars conforming to UN Regulation 48 must have at least a 10cm separation between the closest illuminated edge of any fog light and stop light.</p>\\r\\n<p>The disadvantage with a single fog lamp is that it is slightly more difficult to perceive the distance you are away from it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Fog lights can be distracting and/or blinding to other drivers when there is no fog, so it&rsquo;s important to only turn them on when required. It&rsquo;s actually against the law in New Zealand to use your fog lights when it&rsquo;s not either foggy or snowing, or visibility is significantly reduced in some other way, for example by smoke. If it&rsquo;s clear you are not allowed to use fog lights at night, either.</p>\\r\\n<p>The front-mounted lights are set low and give a short, wide beam of light to help illuminate the way without reflecting a lot of light back at the driver like full-beam headlights would. The centre line of the beam of light emitted from the lamp must be to the left of the centre axis of the vehicle, and they must be permanently dipped.</p>\\r\\n<p>Front fog lights help the driver see the edge of the road more clearly. They also provide two extra points of light that oncoming drivers can see through the fog. In fact, front-mounted fog lamps must not be positioned higher than dipped-beam headlights on the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Vehicles are allowed a maximum of two front fog lights and two rear fog lights in New Zealand.

Overtaking is the most risky manoeuvre on the roads because you expose yourself to traffic travelling in the opposite direction, and often higher speeds are involved. Overtaking requires that you make many more judgments about speed, obstacles and risks than regular motoring.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Overtaking on the right</h2>\\r\\n<p>When you pass on the right you can put your vehicle in danger because you might have to enter a lane or part of the road that&rsquo;s used by oncoming vehicles, you could have to accelerate briskly, you&rsquo;re changing your path of travel and there&rsquo;s a risk that the person you are overtaking hasn&rsquo;t seen you.</p>\\r\\n<p>You should only pass if it&rsquo;s necessary to pass. For example, if you are following someone on the open road doing 95kph, is it really necessary to urgently pass just to do 100kph? Impatience with the vehicle you&rsquo;re following can cause you to make rash decisions and put yourself in danger.</p>\\r\\n<p>Passing is relatively straightforward if you follow the rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>First, you need to prepare to overtake. This means getting your vehicle in a position where the vehicle you are about to overtake, and any vehicles following you, know what your intentions are. This helps prevent a vehicle behind you beginning an overtaking manoeuvre when you are about to pull out to overtake.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then&nbsp;you need to judge distances. As in the question above, you need to be able to see 100m of clear road ahead of you once you have finished overtaking, so you will need to judge your potential acceleration vs the speed of the vehicle you&rsquo;re overtaking.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then&nbsp;you need to read the road ahead and identify dangers. All kinds of dangers exist such as dips, crests, driveways and so on.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check your mirrors to ensure no one else is passing you. If you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s safe to go signal (for 3 seconds) and make your move. Be ready to abort if you assess the situation isn&rsquo;t safe.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signal left and pull back into your lane when you can see the vehicle you are overtaking in your rear view mirror. You should have already made sure your rear view mirror is set so that you can see clearly out of your rear window.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you&rsquo;re overtaking a cyclist, motorbiker or horse, leave extra room.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Overtaking on 3-laned roads</h3>\\r\\n<p>If a road has three lanes with two lanes travelling in the opposite direction, you can overtake if the white line closest to you is broken and there is no traffic coming towards you in the middle lane. If you have a solid yellow or white line, you must not overtake.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/passing-on-three-lane.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>When are you allowed to overtake on the left</h2>\\r\\n<p>You are only allowed to pass on the left when there are two or more lanes on your side of the centre line and the vehicle in the right hand lane is going slower than you, and it is safe to do so (like in the image below); or when a police officer directs you to, or when a vehicle has stopped or slowed down and is signalling a right turn or is making a right turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/passing-left.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>Overtaking on a yellow line</h2>\\r\\n<p>The yellow line is a road marking that you must not cross unless directed to do so by police, or you are turning into a driveway.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/no-passing-line.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"no passing line showing dip and crest\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" />The yellow line is called a no-passing line and it&rsquo;s usually there because it&rsquo;s unsafe to cross the centre line. There might be a hidden dip or crest, or a corner that you can&rsquo;t see through. Or, it might have been an accident blackspot in the past and it is safer to not overtake there.</p>\\r\\n<p>Passing lanes are also marked on three-lane roads so that traffic travelling in the direction with two lanes is not permitted to use the third lane.</p>\\r\\n<p>No-passing lines are warned in advanced with a broken yellow line which you can see starts a A. The line begins at C. You must not start to pass on a broken or dashed yellow line, but you can move back into your lane if you are already overtaking.</p>\\r\\n<p>The only time you can overtake when there is a yellow no-passing line is if the lane is wide enough for two vehicles, you can see 100mm of clear road in front of you for the whole time you are passing, and you stay on your side of the yellow line.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Road Code theory regarding&nbsp;passing</h2>\\r\\n<p>Before passing, ask yourself is it necessary. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hang back and wait, especially if you&rsquo;re feeling impatient as this is often when you make poor judgment and have an accident.</p>\\r\\n<p>Before you pass you need to make sure that you can complete your manoeuvre and still see 100 metres of clear road ahead of you. Look as far ahead as possible, check your mirrors, signal for at least three seconds and move out to pass. (Interestingly, the Road Code does not mention that you should check your blind spots, but you should).</p>\\r\\n<p>Before pulling back in front of the vehicle you&rsquo;ve just passed, signal for at least three seconds and check you can see it in your rear view mirror.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are passing a horse, speed can cause the horse to panic. Give it a wide berth and slow down to overtake. Don&rsquo;t use your horn. <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/when-passing-a-horse-and-rider-what-shou/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">This is the question in the Road Code regarding passing a horse</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are passing cyclists, especially children on bikes, give them a lot of room as gusts of wind can blow them into your path, and your slipstream can also affect them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Stay a safe distance behind the vehicle you&rsquo;re about to pass, and if you are being passed yourself, move left to give yourself a buffer, and don&rsquo;t speed up.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Road markings</h3>\\r\\n<p>If there&rsquo;s a solid yellow line on your side of the road, you must not cross it to overtake. If there&rsquo;s a dashed yellow line it indicates you are coming up on a solid yellow line. You can pass where there&rsquo;s a solid yellow line only if the road is wide enough for two vehicles, you don&rsquo;t cross the line and you can see 100m of clear road ahead for the whole time you are passing.</p>\\r\\n<p>You can use an oncoming passing lane if there is no traffic in the lane.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Where you must not pass</h3>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>If a vehicle has stopped or is slowing down for a pedestrian crossing or a train</li>\\r\\n<li>Any moving vehicle less than 60m from a railway crossing</li>\\r\\n<li>Before a blind corner or anywhere you can&rsquo;t see at least 100m of clear road once you&rsquo;ve passed</li>\\r\\n<li>At an intersection as you risk causing an accident if a vehicle pulls out of the intersection</li>\\r\\n<li>If you have to use a flush median (find out <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/road-position/when-can-flush-medians-be-used-check-all/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">when you are allowed to use a flush median here</a>.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced passing&nbsp;technique</h2>\\r\\n<p>You can get additional passing theory from your driving instructor. The following is advice provided to police drivers and members of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.</p>\\r\\n<p>Overtaking should be seen as a set of hazards that you have to deal with. The main hazard is the vehicle you&rsquo;re overtaking, then there are many minor hazards such as the road surface, the weather, vehicles on the side of the road, pedestrians, animals, and so on. These hazards could be difficult to predict, particularly things like a dog running out in front of you, or the vehicle in front hitting a puddle which causes spray that temporarily affects your view of the road.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Preparing to overtake</h3>\\r\\n<p>The overtaking position is a compromise between staying back a safe distance (two or more seconds), and reducing the time it takes to get past the vehicle in front. There&rsquo;s no specific guidelines about how close you should be to the vehicle in front, except that you should be aware that it is more dangerous because your vision is reduced and if it brakes or stops suddenly you may run into the back of it (<a href=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/tailgating-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-dangerous/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">read our article on tailgating</a> for the reasons why). Following another driver closely for too long might cause them to speed up (which will make it more difficult for you to pass), or become angry at your driving, which could lead to a road rage incident.</p>\\r\\n<p>The overtaking position lets both drivers following you and the driver in the vehicle ahead of you know that you are preparing to overtake. If you are following a large vehicle such as a truck, a car towing a caravan, or agricultural machinery such as a combine harvester then if you are too close you might be hidden from the driver&rsquo;s view. Make sure you can see their mirrors so that they can see you.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the overtaking position you will also be closer to the centre line. Be careful of oncoming traffic, particularly large, wide vehicles, or where the road is narrow or there are other hazards like parked cars on the other side of the road that would mean that oncoming traffic will be closer to the centre line.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you can see ahead that you can&rsquo;t overtake for some time, drop back again to maintain a safe distance.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Judging distance</h3>\\r\\n<p>When you have completed your overtaking manoeuvre you need to be able to pull back to the left, but have you got enough room? Knowing the performance of your car, bike or truck is essential for being able to judge whether you have enough room to complete the manoeuvre.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are overtaking a line of traffic, this is more dangerous as the obstacle is longer and other drivers in the line may pull out to overtake without seeing you. Look for other vehicles beginning to drift towards the centre line even before you see an indicator signal to give you a clue as to a driver&rsquo;s intention, especially if you can see where they are looking and that they have also moved up into an overtaking position. They may be less confident than you, and have therefore waited slightly longer to begin the manoeuvre.</p>\\r\\n<p>This also applies to you: before you make your move, check your mirrors and over your shoulder to ensure another driver hasn&rsquo;t pulled out to pass you. This is less likely to happen if you are clearly signalling your intent, and indicating before you intend to move, but you cannot take it for granted that it won&rsquo;t.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Identifying hazards ahead</h3>\\r\\n<p>Look as far ahead on the road as you can. Are there any side streets, farm gates, driveways or other places vehicles could turn into the road. If there&rsquo;s a right hand turn ahead and you are overtaking a line of traffic, this will be extremely dangerous if one of the vehicles turns right as you are overtaking. It also puts you at risk of a driver turning into your path from a side street without looking.</p>\\r\\n<p>Pay attention to clues that indicate where the road goes beyond where you can see &ndash; the tree line, vehicle lights, lamp posts, etc. New Zealand has a large network of rural roads without streetlights. However, there is often a light at junctions.</p>\\r\\n<p>Look ahead of the vehicle or vehicles you want to overtake and make sure there is a gap you can pull into. If one vehicle is tailgating another then there might not be the gap to pull in if you need to, or it might be that they are ready to overtake.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Making the move</h3>\\r\\n<p>You&rsquo;ve checked the mirrors, signalled and done a final check over your shoulder. Now you can pull into the right lane. You will have a better view of what&rsquo;s ahead. If you have any doubts about whether to complete the move, it&rsquo;s best to pull back into your lane: it&rsquo;s better that you abort the passing attempt than cause a head on collision as the risks of it causing&nbsp;&nbsp;a serious, debilitating injury (if not a fatality) are close to 100% at highway speeds.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are overtaking a line of traffic you need to consider it as a number of smaller overtaking moves that might end up being joined together. At each point where you can pull back into the line of traffic evaluate whether you can continue or whether you should rejoin the line.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Watch your speed</h3>\\r\\n<p>Traffic enforcement agencies must set laws such as speed limits, and unfortunately these can&rsquo;t be flexible otherwise they get abused. Technically, it&rsquo;s safest to complete your overtaking move as quickly as possible staying within the limits of your vehicle and your driving ability. However, the law states that you should remain within the speed limit when overtaking, even though this increases your time exposed to danger.</p>\\r\\n<p>Automated speed cameras will not be lenient if you are driving beyond the speed limit while overtaking. Police officers may or may not be lenient depending on the circumstances. Non-emergency services drivers should overtake only when it&rsquo;s safe to overtake by staying within the speed limit.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"397.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"passing-on-left\",\"canonical\":\"resources/advanced-overtaking-keeping-safe-when-passing/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1412,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"A police officer has directed you to\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 09:25:41.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1413,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"There are two or more lanes on your side of the road and it's safe to pass\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 09:25:41.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1414,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"The car you will pass is signalling a right turn and is either slowing down or has stopped\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 09:25:41.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1415,\"title\":\"The vehicle is a motorbike or scooter on a single lane road and therefore there's enough room to pass safely\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 09:25:41.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":397,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

In fact, if you drive a darker coloured vehicle it is advisable to turn your lights on earlier and off later as some coloured vehicles are <a href=\\\"http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/216475/muarc263.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">more at risk of being in an accident</a>&nbsp;due to visibility issues. Turning on your headlights means turning the main lights on your car on. This will turn both the front and rear lights on.</p>\\r\\n<p>If there are no daytime running lights or automatic lights there will be sidelights that come on the first click of your headlight controls. The second click are the main headlights. To access full beam headlights you'll either push the stalk forwards or pull it back. In most modern cars pulling the headlight stalk back flashes the headlights whereas pushing it forward keeps the headlights on. In some older cars, you would pull the headlight stalk back until it clicks a switch, then pull it back again to cancel the full beam headlights.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Why do other vehicles' headlights come on in a tunnel?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Many newer cars will have daytime running lights which are on all the time, and some have automatic headlights which detect when it's dark enough for headlights to be lit.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>Replacing headlight bulbs</h2>\\r\\n<p>Eventually your headlight bulbs will fail and then your vehicle is not up to Warrant of Fitness standard. You will need to purchase a replacement bulb, which you can do from any automotive store, and fit it yourself. Or take it to a mechanic to replace it. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Replacing a headlight bulb can be tricky. You will probably need to get in the engine bay with a screwdriver. The headlight bulbs are usually held in with a wire clip. You will need a paper towel or cloth to install the new bulb because <a href=\\\"http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=7031.0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">if you get the grease from your skin on them it can create a hotspot</a>&nbsp;which cracks the bulb.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have LED lights they are less likely to fail.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Levelling your headlights</h2>\\r\\n<p>Newer cars tend to have self-levelling headlights. For example, if you are carrying a heavy load in the boot, or a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, the back of the vehicle is pushed down which means the front of the vehicle points up. This means your low-beam headlights could become dazzling to other drivers. Self-levelling headlights automatically adjust downwards.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have self-levelling headlights and you are carrying a heavy load or towing a trailer, there will be a dial somewhere on your dashboard where you can angle the lights downwards.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"433.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"when-must-you-dip-headlights\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/core/turn-your-vehicle-headights/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1560,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"when you are following other vehicles\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:13:27.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1561,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"when a police officer is directing traffic\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:13:27.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1562,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"when you park\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:13:27.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1563,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"when other vehicles are coming towards you\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:13:27.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":433,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

In this example in <a href=\\\"http://www.newzealand.com/sg/article/ponsonby/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Three Lamps, Ponsonby</a>, Auckland, the courtesy crossing sits on a section of one-way street. There's a pedestrian crossing around 50m to the right, and a controlled crossing at the traffic lights around 50m to the left.

In fact, if you drive a darker coloured vehicle it is advisable to turn your lights on earlier and off later as some coloured vehicles are <a href=\\\"http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/216475/muarc263.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">more at risk of being in an accident</a>&nbsp;due to visibility issues. Turning on your headlights means turning the main lights on your car on. This will turn both the front and rear lights on.</p>\\r\\n<p>If there are no daytime running lights or automatic lights there will be sidelights that come on the first click of your headlight controls. The second click are the main headlights. To access full beam headlights you'll either push the stalk forwards or pull it back. In most modern cars pulling the headlight stalk back flashes the headlights whereas pushing it forward keeps the headlights on. In some older cars, you would pull the headlight stalk back until it clicks a switch, then pull it back again to cancel the full beam headlights.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Why do other vehicles' headlights come on in a tunnel?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Many newer cars will have daytime running lights which are on all the time, and some have automatic headlights which detect when it's dark enough for headlights to be lit.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>Replacing headlight bulbs</h2>\\r\\n<p>Eventually your headlight bulbs will fail and then your vehicle is not up to Warrant of Fitness standard. You will need to purchase a replacement bulb, which you can do from any automotive store, and fit it yourself. Or take it to a mechanic to replace it. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Replacing a headlight bulb can be tricky. You will probably need to get in the engine bay with a screwdriver. The headlight bulbs are usually held in with a wire clip. You will need a paper towel or cloth to install the new bulb because <a href=\\\"http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=7031.0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">if you get the grease from your skin on them it can create a hotspot</a>&nbsp;which cracks the bulb.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have LED lights they are less likely to fail.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Levelling your headlights</h2>\\r\\n<p>Newer cars tend to have self-levelling headlights.

By 'legally able' this means of legal age, holding the right type of licence, not under any kind of suspension or disqualification, and not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>\\r\\n<p>You can call a tow truck, but this will be at your expense and could cost a couple of hundred dollars. If you are stopped on the motorway then you will be legally required to move your vehicle&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>If you choose to leave your vehicle on the side of the road then it is at risk of vandalism.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Penalties</h2>\\r\\n<p>If you are 16-19 years old the alcohol limit is zero.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are 20 years old or over, the alcohol limit is 50mg per 100ml of blood or 250mcg per litre of breath. If your test reading is greater than 130mg per 100ml of blood or 650mcg per litre of breath you will receive an immediate on-the-spot licence suspension, as long as you have no prior convictions for operating or attempting to operate a vehicle while intoxicated (&ldquo;under the influence of excess breath alcohol&rdquo;), or for refusing to provide a sample, or for causing death or injury while driving under the influence. If your reading is between 251-400mcg you will receive a $200 fine and 50 demerit points and will be banned from driving for 12 hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have a previous conviction then you will receive the licence suspension immediately you are above the limit.</p>\\r\\n<p>The suspension is for 28 days, and there are court-imposed penalties to add on the top.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Examples of fines and penalties</h2>\\r\\n<p>Killing or injuring someone while you&rsquo;re driving under the influence: up to 10 years in prison, up to $20,000 fine and one year or more disqualification from driving. If you&rsquo;ve already been convicted of a drink-driving offence, then your suspension will likely be more than one year.</p>\\r\\n<p>Driving while under the influence (i.e. more than 80mg/100ml): for a first or second offence you could receive up to 3 months in jail, a fine of up to $4500 and six months or more disqualification. If you have at least two previous convictions then you could face up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $6000, with a disqualification of at least one year. The court may also impose a <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/what-is-a-pink-drivers-licence/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">zero alcohol licence</a>&nbsp;if you&rsquo;ve already been convicted. If it&rsquo;s your first conviction then you may need to use an alcohol interlock after a three-month disqualification.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are under 20 and have more than 30mg/100ml or 150mcg per litre you could face up to 3 months in jail, a fine of up to $2250 and a disqualification of 3 months or more.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you refuse to give blood you could face up to 3 months in jail, a fine of up to $4500 and a disqualification of 6 months or more.

Indicate right as you approach the roundabout. Keep indicating right until you pass the exit just before the one you want to take, then indicate left. Exit the roundabout in the appropriate lane (this will sometimes be defined by road markings; other times you will exit into the right lane if it's a dual carriageway).&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>How do complex roundabouts work?</h2>\\r\\n<p>In the image below you can see the roundabout at the Greenlane motorway on-ramps and off-ramps. On the west entrance (bottom left) there is a feeder lane onto the motorway on-ramp, and two other lanes. There are two lanes at the exit to the east (top right). At the entrance to the roundabout from the east (top right) there are three lanes of which the right hand one turns right and the other two go straight ahead. There's also a feeder lane on to the motorway going south.</p>\\r\\n<p>The motorway off-ramp heading north has two lanes: one has an arrow to the right and the other an arrow to the left. There's no arrow straight on because that will take you back onto the motorway and it would be highly unusual to do that (i.e. only if you'd made a mistake, in which case you wouldn't want to confuse other drivers on the roundabout.

A simple raised island provides a refuge for pedestrians in the middle of the road. Sometimes, if the road is more than two lanes, the crossing will be staggered - the two crossings are not continuous, and the central reservation may be protected by a fence.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/staggered-pedestrian-crossing.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Staggered pedestrian crossing\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"346\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Pedestrians approaching a pedestrian crossing must make sure it is safe to step out into the crossing before they do so. Once the pedestrian is on the crossing, vehicles must give way to them.</p>\\r\\n<p>There are several types of pedestrian crossings including raised crossings, courtesy crossings, staggered crossings, crossings at traffic lights, and <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/you-are-coming-up-to-a-school-patrol-cro/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">school (kea) crossings</a>. Pedestrian crossings, which are called <a href=\\\"http://mocktheorytest.com/resources/pedestrian-crossings-and-islands/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">zebra crossings</a>&nbsp;in some countries, usually have white stripes painted across the road. The approach to the crossing will often have a white diamond if the crossing is slightly obscured - note that that is different to some other countries which have zigzags or other road markings on the approach. There will also be a diamond-shaped yellow sign with a pedestrian crossing symbol.

For example this image is on Scotland St outside the supermarket&nbsp;on College Hill, Auckland. Scotland St is quite wide and College Hill is busy with a lot of traffic turning into Scotland St to go to the supermarket.

In fact, if you drive a darker coloured vehicle it is advisable to turn your lights on earlier and off later as some coloured vehicles are <a href=\\\"http://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/216475/muarc263.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">more at risk of being in an accident</a>&nbsp;due to visibility issues. Turning on your headlights means turning the main lights on your car on. This will turn both the front and rear lights on.</p>\\r\\n<p>If there are no daytime running lights or automatic lights there will be sidelights that come on the first click of your headlight controls. The second click are the main headlights. To access full beam headlights you'll either push the stalk forwards or pull it back. In most modern cars pulling the headlight stalk back flashes the headlights whereas pushing it forward keeps the headlights on. In some older cars, you would pull the headlight stalk back until it clicks a switch, then pull it back again to cancel the full beam headlights.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Why do other vehicles' headlights come on in a tunnel?</h2>\\r\\n<p>Many newer cars will have daytime running lights which are on all the time, and some have automatic headlights which detect when it's dark enough for headlights to be lit.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>Replacing headlight bulbs</h2>\\r\\n<p>Eventually your headlight bulbs will fail and then your vehicle is not up to Warrant of Fitness standard. You will need to purchase a replacement bulb, which you can do from any automotive store, and fit it yourself. Or take it to a mechanic to replace it. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Replacing a headlight bulb can be tricky. You will probably need to get in the engine bay with a screwdriver. The headlight bulbs are usually held in with a wire clip. You will need a paper towel or cloth to install the new bulb because <a href=\\\"http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=7031.0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">if you get the grease from your skin on them it can create a hotspot</a>&nbsp;which cracks the bulb.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have LED lights they are less likely to fail.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Levelling your headlights</h2>\\r\\n<p>Newer cars tend to have self-levelling headlights.

If an engine is tuned well and not using oil, the amount of smoke from the exhaust will be minimal.</p>\\r\\n<p>When a vehicle is cold you will see vapour coming from the exhaust that disappears once the engine is warm. Once a well-tuned, good-condition engine is warm, there will be very little visible smoke unless a lot of throttle (acceleration) is applied.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Three main types of engine smoke</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Black smoke</h3>\\r\\n<p>Black smoke can indicate that one or more of the spark plugs needs replacing, or that there&rsquo;s the wrong mixture of fuel/air in the engine. In a fuel-injected vehicle problems with a number of parts could cause black smoke: cam sensor, fuel injector, map sensor, ECM computer, fuel pressure regulator, or ignition circuit. It&rsquo;s usually possible to change the spark plugs easily. If this doesn&rsquo;t fix it you might need to see a mechanic.</p>\\r\\n<h3>White smoke</h3>\\r\\n<p>If your head gasket is blown or the cylinder head is cracked it will cause white smoke with no real smell. The white smoke is caused by water mixing with the fuel, and can be the result of a leak in the <a href=\\\"http://www.enginebasics.com/Engine%20Basics%20Root%20Folder/Intake%20Manifold.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">intake manifold</a>&nbsp;(also called inlet manifold), too. You&rsquo;ll need to see a mechanic.</p>\\r\\n<p>If the smoke is a light grey/white, it could be from transmission fluid. You&rsquo;ll need a mechanic.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Blue smoke</h3>\\r\\n<p>Blue smoke is caused by the engine burning oil. This should be investigated because it can eventually result in the engine seizing. It can be caused by a number of things such as not changing the oil for a long time, worn rings, a <a href=\\\"http://www.agcoauto.com/content/news/p2_articleid/197\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">plugged PCV valve</a>, fault valve stem seals, too much oil, or transmission fluid being sucked into the intake manifold. The worst case scenario is an engine rebuild.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Pollution</h2>\\r\\n<p>Particulates from exhaust gases cause pollution. The government has progressively introduced more and more stringent requirements for vehicle emissions to help improve our environment as the number of vehicles on the road increases. Airborne pollutants are particularly problematic when there are light winds as they don't blow away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Exhaust gases consist of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and (if you drive a diesel) oxygen. All these are fairly benign, but it&rsquo;s the trace elements that are the problem. They are nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrocarbons and, if it&rsquo;s a diesel engine, diesel soot and particulate matter.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"3.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"visible-smoke\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/intersection/visible-smoke/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":10,\"title\":\"12 seconds\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:47:18.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":11,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"10 seconds\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:47:18.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":12,\"title\":\"8 seconds\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:47:18.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":13,\"title\":\"5 seconds\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-31 21:47:18.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":3,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

Overtaking is the most risky manoeuvre on the roads because you expose yourself to traffic travelling in the opposite direction, and often higher speeds are involved. Overtaking requires that you make many more judgments about speed, obstacles and risks than regular motoring.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Overtaking on the right</h2>\\r\\n<p>When you pass on the right you can put your vehicle in danger because you might have to enter a lane or part of the road that&rsquo;s used by oncoming vehicles, you could have to accelerate briskly, you&rsquo;re changing your path of travel and there&rsquo;s a risk that the person you are overtaking hasn&rsquo;t seen you.</p>\\r\\n<p>You should only pass if it&rsquo;s necessary to pass. For example, if you are following someone on the open road doing 95kph, is it really necessary to urgently pass just to do 100kph? Impatience with the vehicle you&rsquo;re following can cause you to make rash decisions and put yourself in danger.</p>\\r\\n<p>Passing is relatively straightforward if you follow the rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>First, you need to prepare to overtake. This means getting your vehicle in a position where the vehicle you are about to overtake, and any vehicles following you, know what your intentions are. This helps prevent a vehicle behind you beginning an overtaking manoeuvre when you are about to pull out to overtake.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then&nbsp;you need to judge distances. As in the question above, you need to be able to see 100m of clear road ahead of you once you have finished overtaking, so you will need to judge your potential acceleration vs the speed of the vehicle you&rsquo;re overtaking.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then&nbsp;you need to read the road ahead and identify dangers. All kinds of dangers exist such as dips, crests, driveways and so on.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check your mirrors to ensure no one else is passing you. If you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s safe to go signal (for 3 seconds) and make your move. Be ready to abort if you assess the situation isn&rsquo;t safe.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signal left and pull back into your lane when you can see the vehicle you are overtaking in your rear view mirror. You should have already made sure your rear view mirror is set so that you can see clearly out of your rear window.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you&rsquo;re overtaking a cyclist, motorbiker or horse, leave extra room.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Overtaking on 3-laned roads</h3>\\r\\n<p>If a road has three lanes with two lanes travelling in the opposite direction, you can overtake if the white line closest to you is broken and there is no traffic coming towards you in the middle lane. If you have a solid yellow or white line, you must not overtake.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/passing-on-three-lane.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>When are you allowed to overtake on the left</h2>\\r\\n<p>You are only allowed to pass on the left when there are two or more lanes on your side of the centre line and the vehicle in the right hand lane is going slower than you, and it is safe to do so (like in the image below); or when a police officer directs you to, or when a vehicle has stopped or slowed down and is signalling a right turn or is making a right turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/passing-left.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>Overtaking on a yellow line</h2>\\r\\n<p>The yellow line is a road marking that you must not cross unless directed to do so by police, or you are turning into a driveway.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/no-passing-line.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"no passing line showing dip and crest\\\" width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"200\\\" />The yellow line is called a no-passing line and it&rsquo;s usually there because it&rsquo;s unsafe to cross the centre line. There might be a hidden dip or crest, or a corner that you can&rsquo;t see through. Or, it might have been an accident blackspot in the past and it is safer to not overtake there.</p>\\r\\n<p>Passing lanes are also marked on three-lane roads so that traffic travelling in the direction with two lanes is not permitted to use the third lane.</p>\\r\\n<p>No-passing lines are warned in advanced with a broken yellow line which you can see starts a A. The line begins at C. You must not start to pass on a broken or dashed yellow line, but you can move back into your lane if you are already overtaking.</p>\\r\\n<p>The only time you can overtake when there is a yellow no-passing line is if the lane is wide enough for two vehicles, you can see 100mm of clear road in front of you for the whole time you are passing, and you stay on your side of the yellow line.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Road Code theory regarding&nbsp;passing</h2>\\r\\n<p>Before passing, ask yourself is it necessary. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to hang back and wait, especially if you&rsquo;re feeling impatient as this is often when you make poor judgment and have an accident.</p>\\r\\n<p>Before you pass you need to make sure that you can complete your manoeuvre and still see 100 metres of clear road ahead of you. Look as far ahead as possible, check your mirrors, signal for at least three seconds and move out to pass. (Interestingly, the Road Code does not mention that you should check your blind spots, but you should).</p>\\r\\n<p>Before pulling back in front of the vehicle you&rsquo;ve just passed, signal for at least three seconds and check you can see it in your rear view mirror.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are passing a horse, speed can cause the horse to panic. Give it a wide berth and slow down to overtake. Don&rsquo;t use your horn. <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/when-passing-a-horse-and-rider-what-shou/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">This is the question in the Road Code regarding passing a horse</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are passing cyclists, especially children on bikes, give them a lot of room as gusts of wind can blow them into your path, and your slipstream can also affect them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Stay a safe distance behind the vehicle you&rsquo;re about to pass, and if you are being passed yourself, move left to give yourself a buffer, and don&rsquo;t speed up.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Road markings</h3>\\r\\n<p>If there&rsquo;s a solid yellow line on your side of the road, you must not cross it to overtake. If there&rsquo;s a dashed yellow line it indicates you are coming up on a solid yellow line. You can pass where there&rsquo;s a solid yellow line only if the road is wide enough for two vehicles, you don&rsquo;t cross the line and you can see 100m of clear road ahead for the whole time you are passing.</p>\\r\\n<p>You can use an oncoming passing lane if there is no traffic in the lane.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Where you must not pass</h3>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>If a vehicle has stopped or is slowing down for a pedestrian crossing or a train</li>\\r\\n<li>Any moving vehicle less than 60m from a railway crossing</li>\\r\\n<li>Before a blind corner or anywhere you can&rsquo;t see at least 100m of clear road once you&rsquo;ve passed</li>\\r\\n<li>At an intersection as you risk causing an accident if a vehicle pulls out of the intersection</li>\\r\\n<li>If you have to use a flush median (find out <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/road-position/when-can-flush-medians-be-used-check-all/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">when you are allowed to use a flush median here</a>.)</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Advanced passing&nbsp;technique</h2>\\r\\n<p>You can get additional passing theory from your driving instructor. The following is advice provided to police drivers and members of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.</p>\\r\\n<p>Overtaking should be seen as a set of hazards that you have to deal with. The main hazard is the vehicle you&rsquo;re overtaking, then there are many minor hazards such as the road surface, the weather, vehicles on the side of the road, pedestrians, animals, and so on. These hazards could be difficult to predict, particularly things like a dog running out in front of you, or the vehicle in front hitting a puddle which causes spray that temporarily affects your view of the road.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Preparing to overtake</h3>\\r\\n<p>The overtaking position is a compromise between staying back a safe distance (two or more seconds), and reducing the time it takes to get past the vehicle in front. There&rsquo;s no specific guidelines about how close you should be to the vehicle in front, except that you should be aware that it is more dangerous because your vision is reduced and if it brakes or stops suddenly you may run into the back of it (<a href=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/tailgating-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-dangerous/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">read our article on tailgating</a> for the reasons why). Following another driver closely for too long might cause them to speed up (which will make it more difficult for you to pass), or become angry at your driving, which could lead to a road rage incident.</p>\\r\\n<p>The overtaking position lets both drivers following you and the driver in the vehicle ahead of you know that you are preparing to overtake. If you are following a large vehicle such as a truck, a car towing a caravan, or agricultural machinery such as a combine harvester then if you are too close you might be hidden from the driver&rsquo;s view. Make sure you can see their mirrors so that they can see you.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the overtaking position you will also be closer to the centre line. Be careful of oncoming traffic, particularly large, wide vehicles, or where the road is narrow or there are other hazards like parked cars on the other side of the road that would mean that oncoming traffic will be closer to the centre line.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you can see ahead that you can&rsquo;t overtake for some time, drop back again to maintain a safe distance.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Judging distance</h3>\\r\\n<p>When you have completed your overtaking manoeuvre you need to be able to pull back to the left, but have you got enough room? Knowing the performance of your car, bike or truck is essential for being able to judge whether you have enough room to complete the manoeuvre.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are overtaking a line of traffic, this is more dangerous as the obstacle is longer and other drivers in the line may pull out to overtake without seeing you. Look for other vehicles beginning to drift towards the centre line even before you see an indicator signal to give you a clue as to a driver&rsquo;s intention, especially if you can see where they are looking and that they have also moved up into an overtaking position. They may be less confident than you, and have therefore waited slightly longer to begin the manoeuvre.</p>\\r\\n<p>This also applies to you: before you make your move, check your mirrors and over your shoulder to ensure another driver hasn&rsquo;t pulled out to pass you. This is less likely to happen if you are clearly signalling your intent, and indicating before you intend to move, but you cannot take it for granted that it won&rsquo;t.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Identifying hazards ahead</h3>\\r\\n<p>Look as far ahead on the road as you can. Are there any side streets, farm gates, driveways or other places vehicles could turn into the road. If there&rsquo;s a right hand turn ahead and you are overtaking a line of traffic, this will be extremely dangerous if one of the vehicles turns right as you are overtaking. It also puts you at risk of a driver turning into your path from a side street without looking.</p>\\r\\n<p>Pay attention to clues that indicate where the road goes beyond where you can see &ndash; the tree line, vehicle lights, lamp posts, etc. New Zealand has a large network of rural roads without streetlights. However, there is often a light at junctions.</p>\\r\\n<p>Look ahead of the vehicle or vehicles you want to overtake and make sure there is a gap you can pull into. If one vehicle is tailgating another then there might not be the gap to pull in if you need to, or it might be that they are ready to overtake.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Making the move</h3>\\r\\n<p>You&rsquo;ve checked the mirrors, signalled and done a final check over your shoulder. Now you can pull into the right lane. You will have a better view of what&rsquo;s ahead. If you have any doubts about whether to complete the move, it&rsquo;s best to pull back into your lane: it&rsquo;s better that you abort the passing attempt than cause a head on collision as the risks of it causing&nbsp;&nbsp;a serious, debilitating injury (if not a fatality) are close to 100% at highway speeds.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are overtaking a line of traffic you need to consider it as a number of smaller overtaking moves that might end up being joined together. At each point where you can pull back into the line of traffic evaluate whether you can continue or whether you should rejoin the line.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Watch your speed</h3>\\r\\n<p>Traffic enforcement agencies must set laws such as speed limits, and unfortunately these can&rsquo;t be flexible otherwise they get abused. Technically, it&rsquo;s safest to complete your overtaking move as quickly as possible staying within the limits of your vehicle and your driving ability. However, the law states that you should remain within the speed limit when overtaking, even though this increases your time exposed to danger.</p>\\r\\n<p>Automated speed cameras will not be lenient if you are driving beyond the speed limit while overtaking. Police officers may or may not be lenient depending on the circumstances. Non-emergency services drivers should overtake only when it&rsquo;s safe to overtake by staying within the speed limit.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"396.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"passing-on-right\",\"canonical\":\"resources/advanced-overtaking-keeping-safe-when-passing/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1408,\"title\":\"When you can see at least 50m ahead of you when you start passing\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:01:37.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1409,\"title\":\"When you've signalled right for at least two seconds\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:01:37.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1410,\"title\":\"When it's safe to exceed the speed limit for a short time to get past\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:01:37.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1411,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"When you will be able to see at least 100m ahead of you when you've finished passing\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:01:37.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":396,\"correct_text\":\"You can overtake if you'll be able to see 100m ahead once you've finished passing, you won't endanger other road users, you've indicated for three seconds to warn other road users, and you don't need to exceed the speed limit\",\"incorrect_text\":\"You can overtake if you'll be able to see 100m ahead once you've finished passing, you won't endanger other road users, you've indicated for three seconds to warn other road users, and you don't need to exceed the speed limit\",\"correct_image_name\":null,\"incorrect_image_name\":null,\"correct_video\":null,\"incorrect_video\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:01:37.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},\"section\":\"car\"},{\"id\":22,\"title\":\"What is the legal definition of a road?\",\"description\":\"<h1>The legal definition of a road in New Zealand</h1>\\r\\n<p><strong>Car parks, wharves, riverbeds, beaches, road shoulders and bridges are included in the definition of a road.</strong> Streets, ways, highways, public highways and public roads are simply words that mean a road of a certain kind.&nbsp;A place to which the public have access, whether as of right or not.</p>\\r\\n<p>With them being designated a road it allows NZTA to apply rules to them to keep people safe, restrict certain vehicles and certain usages, and protect certain areas. For example, beaches are specifically included as roads so that speed limits and road worthiness can be enforced.</p>\\r\\n<p>There can often be some confusion over what people think a 'road' is, and what the actual legal definition of a road is.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>The original definition of a road comes from <a href=\\\"http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/commonlaw.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">English common law</a>&nbsp;that was put into practice in New Zealand. A very simple test is used: is there a right of way or right of passage granted to the public by the land owner? It was the permission for public use that was the important part; a legal road could be owned by a private individual but given for use by the public.</p>\\r\\n<p>The modern definition of 'use' means that the public in general must have access, not just a section of them, and that the road must be being used by the public.</p>\\r\\n<p>Once you have this rule then you can prevent people from interfering with the rights of road users to use the road and travel from one place to another.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were three types of roads:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Footpaths - only for use by pedestrians</li>\\r\\n<li>Bridleways - for use by pedestrians and animals</li>\\r\\n<li>Carriageways - for use by pedestrians, animals and vehicles.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Even though roads are fairly well defined now, there are still facets of the law that make it difficult to be black and white about what is a road and what isn't a road in some circumstances. The Acts that define what a road is don't grant rights of access or passage, they simply seek to define what is allowable should the public have rights of access or passage.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Definition of a road for insurance purposes</h2>\\r\\n<p>Your insurance company might have a completely different definition of what a road is. For example, a specific beach might be a road but if you get your vehicle stuck on it&nbsp;and the tide washes through it writing it off, you might not be insured for a number of reasons (driving off-road, driving recklessly, etc) - insurance companies tend to have a large number of exit clauses.

Our ears are at their most sensitive at around 2kHz, therefore the least&nbsp;energy is required by the siren to generate a sound that is the most audible to humans. As well as the oscillating siren which goes up and down in pitch, some emergency vehicles can use short bursts of sound with a broader frequency range. These interrupt the siren and are also better for helping you to spatially locate the siren. This is because sounds between 1-3kHz are quite <a href=\\\"http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=75\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">difficult to locate spatially</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>Different countries use different siren sounds.

You may be fined for doing so because you put other road users in danger. The onus is on the emergency vehicle to find a way through. If you can move to the side of the lane without entering the intersection, then do that. Emergency vehicle drivers are trained not to pressurise other drivers where it might cause them to do something illegal or dangerous. On a motorway in stop-start rush hour traffic, they will be far more aggressive at getting vehicles to move than they will be at traffic lights where other vehicles are entering the intersection.</p>\\r\\n<p>You should also not drive up on a footpath.

You must be able to stop and the other vehicle must be able to stop, too, therefore the distance is halved.</p>\\r\\n<p>Unlaned roads are often of poorer quality road surface, too, and therefore stopping distances are likely to be longer.

As you can see in the video below, if you get caught out on the crossing, the train cannot stop quickly.</p>\\r\\n<p>Therefore, as you approach a railway level crossing, check how many lines you will need to cross, and that there is enough room for you to pass over the crossing and leave at least 5 metres behind you (5m is about the length of a large car).</p>\\r\\n<p>Be careful in rush hour because vehicles can be slow moving and stop suddenly. Also be careful where there is an intersection&nbsp;soon after the railway crossing because a large vehicle could stop to turn left (if there are pedestrians crossing) or right (if it has to wait for oncoming traffic) and block the road, causing vehicles to stack up behind it. Crossings where this is a risk often have yellow <a href=\\\"http://www.udel.edu/artfoundations/drawing/crosshatch.html\\\">cross-hatches</a>&nbsp;on them that warn drivers not to block the lanes.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you do inadvertently become stranded on the lines, you might be able to drive around the barrier to get off the track. If you can't get off the track, get out of the vehicle and move well out of the way, towards the direction that a train is coming, in case the train hits the vehicle and it ricochets out of the way.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>As you can see in this satellite photo of the crossing on Morningside Drive, Auckland, there is a long cross-hatched area (marked in yellow lines) which is the no stopping area across the tracks. To the left in the image there is a left turn immediately after it (McDonald), and a bit further on (out of view) a road to the right. On the right of the image, traffic will queue at the traffic lights onto New North Road.

over.</strong> Stop if necessary. If a police car is following you with its lights flashing (which will be red and blue), then you must stop unless it passes you and continues on its way.</p>\\r\\n<h1>Improving your awareness of emergency vehicles when driving</h1>\\r\\n<p>Loud music can obscure the sound of sirens, as can ear plugs and a loud exhaust if you are riding a motorbike.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you don't check your rear view mirror frequently you could miss an emergency vehicle trying to get past you.</p>\\r\\n<p>A siren is an oscillating tone usually in a range within 1-3kHz. Our ears are at their most sensitive at around 2kHz, therefore the least&nbsp;energy is required by the siren to generate a sound that is the most audible to humans. As well as the oscillating siren which goes up and down in pitch, some emergency vehicles can use short bursts of sound with a broader frequency range. These interrupt the siren and are also better for helping you to spatially locate the siren. This is because sounds between 1-3kHz are quite <a href=\\\"http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=75\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">difficult to locate spatially</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p>Different countries use different siren sounds. If you are new to driving in New Zealand, our sirens are fairly similar to American sirens.

You may be fined for doing so because you put other road users in danger. The onus is on the emergency vehicle to find a way through. If you can move to the side of the lane without entering the intersection, then do that. Emergency vehicle drivers are trained not to pressurise other drivers where it might cause them to do something illegal or dangerous. On a motorway in stop-start rush hour traffic, they will be far more aggressive at getting vehicles to move than they will be at traffic lights where other vehicles are entering the intersection.</p>\\r\\n<p>You should also not drive up on a footpath.

Select all that apply.\",\"description\":\"<p><strong>If glass falls on to the road from your vehicle you must stop and remove the glass yourself if it can be done quickly and safely, or tell the police if you can't remove it because you are physically incapacitated.</strong></p>\\r\\n<h1>What is automotive glass?</h1>\\r\\n<p>Even though automotive glass looks similar to regular glass, it&rsquo;s quite different. It&rsquo;s manufactured to work within the vehicle&rsquo;s construction to provide protection and added rigidity. If you look closely, you can see some differences. For example, the glass in your rear window will have wires running through it through which a current is passed that heats the glass to evaporate condensation. On some vehicles, the front window has an antenna embedded in it for the radio.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What are the types of automotive glass?</h2>\\r\\n<p>There are three main areas where different types of glass might be used on your vehicle.</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Windscreen/windshield and sunroof: this uses laminated glass which is very strong</li>\\r\\n<li>Side and rear windows: these use tempered glass</li>\\r\\n<li>Lights: glass was used on older vehicles but has been replaced by plastics</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Laminated glass</h2>\\r\\n<p>By law a windscreen must be made of laminated glass and this is usually a sandwich of two 2.1mm layers of glass with a 0.8mm sheet polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in the middle. They are fused together to form a strong, curved sheet which won&rsquo;t shatter into pieces on impact. The film holds the glass together in one sheet, helping prevent shards of glass enter the cabin as they stick to the film. As the plastic sheet is stretchy, it helps absorb any impact, e.g. a deer hitting the windscreen.</p>\\r\\n<p>The PVB filters out the majority of the sun&rsquo;s UV A and UV B rays (95% or more), helping protect occupants from sunburn as it's the equivalent of wearing factor 50 sun screen. As the glass is so strong, it helps with structural rigidity. In a rollover crash it will help prevent the roof from buckling downwards.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Tempered glass</h2>\\r\\n<p>Tempered glass is rapidly heated and cooled several times. If broken, it shatters into lots of small pieces that aren&rsquo;t as sharp or likely to cause damage to vehicle occupants in an accident. Tempered glass is strong enough to withstand fairly strong impacts and closing the door hard. It&rsquo;s also safer to have tempered glass on side windows if you end up in a situation such as the vehicle being underwater or in an accident where the doors can&rsquo;t be opened, because the glass can be broken by kicking it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Tempered glass does not block UV rays as well as laminated glass unless it's been specifically UV-treated. <a href=\\\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/glass-car-windows-doesnt-fully-protect-suns-uv-rays-could-explain-left-side-skin-255398\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Typical SPF protection is around 20</a>&nbsp;in glass that is not specifically treated, and around 45 in glass that is. Tinting a vehicle's windows increases the SPF.</p>\\r\\n<p>Some fleet vehicle operators request laminated glass all around for vehicles that contain high-value equipment.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"69.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"what-must-you-do-if-glass-falls-on-to-th\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/emergencies/what-must-you-do-if-glass-falls-on-to-th/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":256,\"title\":\"Nothing is required - council road workers will remove it in due course\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 08:45:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":257,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Stop and remove the glass yourself if it can be done quickly and safely\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 08:45:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":258,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Tell the police if you can't remove it because you are physically incapacitated\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 08:45:47.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":69,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction.

They are less complex than crossroads. T intersections work well in low and medium volumes of traffic but can be difficult to emerge from when turning right if traffic is heavy. When a T-intersection gets busy, or there are a number of accidents, it might have traffic lights installed to control when vehicles can go. Otherwise the intersection might be uncontrolled (no lines), a give way (a white line) or a stop (yellow line).</p>\\r\\n<p>When a stop sign is placed at a T-intersection it is usually because visibility of the road is restricted as you approach it.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"454.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"which-are-t-intersections\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/intersection/which-are-t-intersections/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1640,\"title\":\"A\",\"image_name\":\"q182b.jpg\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-24 11:47:24.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1641,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"B\",\"image_name\":\"q175b.jpg\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-24 11:47:24.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1642,\"title\":\"C\",\"image_name\":\"q194b.jpg\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-24 11:47:24.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1643,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"D\",\"image_name\":\"q172b.jpg\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-24 11:47:24.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":454,\"correct_text\":\"When two roads meet and form a T shape, it's called a T-intersection.

In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction.

In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction.

The red car has to give way to you because it is turning right across your path.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q174b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"248\\\" height=\\\"155\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>While the general rule is give way to the right at an uncontrolled intersection, that only applies at a crossroads. In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction. At a controlled intersection you would either be waiting at a stop sign or a give way sign.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q175b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The red car is coming from straight ahead and you are turning right therefore you must let it past before you can turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q176b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Even though the red car is on the right, it is waiting at a give way sign and you are passing straight through the junction. Therefore you have the right of way. The same would apply if it was waiting at a stop sign.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q177b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning left and the red car is turning right and would have to cross your path. This used to be the rule in New Zealand until it was changed in 2012. Now, you have the right of way and can turn before the red car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q178b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning right and so is the red car. Which one gives way? The red car is on the bottom of the T-intersection (imagine rotating the picture 90 degrees clockwise). You are driving on the top of the T therefore you can go.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q179b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning left and there's a red car coming from your right along the road. You have to wait because you are on the bottom of the T.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q182b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>This is a tricky one. It's an uncontrolled intersection and both of you are travelling straight ahead. Who has to give way? The rules are that you give way to the right when there are no other controls like a stop sign, therefore the red car must stop and wait for you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q187b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Remember our stop sign rule. At an uncontrolled intersection or one where you were both waiting at a give way sign, you would have right of way. However, you are waiting at a stop sign and that means that the red car has priority, even though it's turning across in front of you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q192b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>When both cars are turning right at an uncontrolled intersection (which includes many driveways and entrances to public car parks that don't have markings), you must give way to vehicles on the straight road (i.e. the top of the T). The blue car has right of way - the red car must wait for you to turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q193b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Even though you have a green light, so does the red car, and it is heading straight through the intersection while you want to turn, therefore you have to wait.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q194b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You both have a green light, but because you are turning left you can go first.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q196b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You both have a green light but the motorbike is turning left, therefore you must wait for it before you can turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q197b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In this scenario neither car needs to cross each other's path. Both are on a green light. If this was an uncontrolled intersection this manoeuvre is actually safer when the cars pass behind one another rather than in front. This is because when passing like in the diagram, your vision up the road to the left is obscured.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q198b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On a roundabout you always give way to the right, so you have to wait for the red car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q199b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The red car must give way to you as you are coming from its right, passing straight through the roundabout.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q200b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In this case you are deviating from the centre line, even though you want to drive straight ahead. The red car has right of way.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q201b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Both of you can complete your manoeuvre without interfering with each other's trajectories.</p>\\r\\n<p>This video from NZTA explains the main give way rules as they changed in 2012 to match international standards.</p>\\r\\n<p><object width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"360\\\"><param name=\\\"movie\\\" value=\\\"//www.youtube.com/v/azlGcWQLFCY?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\\\" /><param name=\\\"allowFullScreen\\\" value=\\\"true\\\" /><param name=\\\"allowscriptaccess\\\" value=\\\"always\\\" /><embed src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/v/azlGcWQLFCY?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\\\" type=\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"360\\\" allowscriptaccess=\\\"always\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"allowfullscreen\\\" /></object></p>\\r\\n<h2>Queuing across intersections</h2>\\r\\n<p>You are not permitted to queue across an intersection if there is a yellow hatched box painted on the road.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/intersection-blocking-rule.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"218\\\" height=\\\"175\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In the example above, the vehicle at C can cross the intersection because there is room the other side of the red box.

As vehicles exit the intersection they will have to nose out further to see up the road and this puts them in danger. While some expensive cars have cameras that look up the road, most people will have to get their bonnet into the lane to be able to see, and that means that other vehicles have to swerve around it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Six metres is a good compromise between using all the available parking and not restricting road users' visibility. On some intersections this isn't an issue and you might find marked bays or a parking line closer than six metres to the intersection.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Pedestrian crossings</h3>\\r\\n<p>You also must park at least 6m away from a pedestrian crossing - 6m is about 1.5 times the length of a medium-sized car.

If the wheels are angled outwards the car will turn towards&nbsp;the traffic lanes creating a risk to other road users.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Checkbox\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"46.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"when-parking-downhill-on-a-steep-road-wh\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/parking/when-parking-downhill-on-a-steep-road-wh/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":164,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Turn the wheels towards the kerb\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:24:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":165,\"title\":\"Turn your wheels away from the kerb\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:24:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":166,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Put your car in reverse gear if it has manual transmission, or in park if it has automatic transmission\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:24:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":167,\"title\":\"Leave your hazard lights on\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:24:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":168,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Put your handbrake on\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-03-06 08:24:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":46,\"correct_text\":\"The Road Code doesn't specifically say to put your handbrake on, but a manual car will roll forwards if you don't, and an automatic car's park brake may be damaged.\",\"incorrect_text\":\"The road code says you should turn your wheels towards the kerb and leave it in reverse or park.

As they are controlled, the controllers will wait until a number of children have arrived before allowing the group to cross, rather than just have a pedestrian crossing with children crossing as they arrive, which holds up traffic more frequently.</p>\\r\\n<p>The stop signs provide an added safety feature to protect children that might just step into the crossing without waiting for vehicles to stop for them.</p>\\r\\n<p>As these crossings are sometimes almost exclusively used by school children, they are infrequently used through the day. Drivers who frequent the route can become used to there never being anyone on the crossing. The additional visibility and the signs make it easier for motorists to see and observe the rules.</p>\\r\\n<p>If there's no school patrol crossing then the road functions as a normal road.

This is often due to subsidence when a road is built on a marshy area or next to a river or stream. When it gets too bad road workers come in and patch up the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>With uneven and bumpy road surfaces truck drivers must pay special attention as the bumps can cause loads to shift. Motorcyclists can also be unsteadied by the bumps.</p>\\r\\n<p>In severe cases the bumps can use up the maximum travel of your suspension which could cause damage to your vehicle, or could bump you off the road. Of course, if there's a bump there must be a corresponding dip and vice versa. You will have less grip in the dips because of your forward momentum as your suspension tries to make the wheel follow the road. Around corners this can make it more difficult to hold a steady line and, if the road is slippery, could cause you to either understeer or oversteer.</p>\\r\\n<p>When turning, understeer can be caused if the front of the vehicle is bounced and therefore has less weight over it; oversteer can be caused by a bounce that makes the back of the vehicle light while a compression at the front increases the grip.</p>\\r\\n<p>Both of these scenarios will only happen if you are driving too fast for the conditions.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Motorcyclists</h2>\\r\\n<p>Motorcyclists carrying pillion passengers should take extra care on bumpy roads and tell your passenger to hold on. When riding on a bumpy surface feet should be firm on the footrests, keep your arms bent slightly, look straight ahead and stay seated in the correct position.&nbsp;Keep your head up, relax and let the bike move underneath you a little rather than fighting it, ride in the left wheel track if there is one, and brake using the front brake first, then the rear brake.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"uneven-road-surface-sign.gif\",\"audioName\":\"425.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"uneven-road-ahead\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/signs/uneven-road-ahead/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1528,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Uneven road surface ahead\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:31:00.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1529,\"title\":\"Road bump ahead\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:31:00.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1530,\"title\":\"Road dip ahead\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:31:00.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1531,\"title\":\"Slippery road ahead\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:31:00.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":425,\"correct_text\":\"This sign warns you of an uneven road ahead.

Once the old surface is removed, the road will be rough and will have stones and other debris.</p>\\r\\n<p>When the new surface is applied, it could be asphalt, or it could be chip-seal. Asphalt is smoother, has less road noise and is more durable against braking vehicles, but has reduced skid resistance in the wet. Chip-seal is cheaper to apply and has more grip when it's new because it's coarser.</p>\\r\\n<p>When chip-seal is laid there is a surplus of loose stones and stones that get dislodged. These collect in ridges as vehicles drive over the new surface. Road sweepers periodically attend and brush away the stones, and general vehicle traffic disperses other stones. The stone ridges are dangerous for motorbikes, and for four-wheeled vehicles if they accumulate on corners.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Repairs</h2>\\r\\n<p>Potholes and other cracks in the road surface have to be fixed and this can be done by either directly filling the pothole, or digging up part of the road.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h2>Services maintenance</h2>\\r\\n<p>As there are buried cables and pipes underneath roads, sometimes they need to be dug up to be replaced or maintained. This can create areas where there are loose stones on the road.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Landslips</h2>\\r\\n<p>Landslips across the road can leave loose stones as the slip is removed. Smaller slips can create smaller piles of stones which get spread along the road and are difficult and time-consuming to clear up manually.

spreading stone chip over a layer of hot sprayed bitumen. City streets and motorways have a different asphalt mix, but all will end up with some or all of the following signs of fatigue.</p>\\r\\n<h2>What asphalt maintenance is required?</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Block cracking</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-724\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-block-cracking-300x148.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-block-cracking\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"148\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Large rectangular cracks appear on the surface. They are not necessarily deep and are actually made worse by low traffic volumes. If block cracking is premature the usual cause of it is human error: road workers place the mix too dry. It also happens when the road gets old. It can be fixed with a thin overlay, or special treatment of the crack.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Settlement depressions</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-725\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-compression-puddles-300x143.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-compression-puddles\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"143\\\" />Settlement depressions are caused when the underlying base is compressed over time, or settles naturally. This causes lower areas in the tarmac where water can pool. If this water is deep enough it can cause problems with aquaplaning. Settlement depressions are low priority in terms of fixing.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Fatigue (alligator) cracking</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-726\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-fatigue-cracking-300x171.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-fatigue-cracking\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"171\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Alligator cracking consists of many small cracks that look similar to a reptile&rsquo;s scales. It has many causes such as poor drainage, a thin or weak surface or base, or excessive heavy traffic. Small weaknesses in the surface quickly spread. The asphalt must be completely removed and replaced to its full depth.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Longitudinal cracking</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-727\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-longitudinal-cracking-300x174.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-longitudinal-cracking\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"174\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Tarmac is almost never laid in one sheet for the entire road width, and that means that there are joints. Longitudinal cracking is almost always caused by poorly constructed paving joints, and therefore mostly appear down the centre of the road. If there are large temperature variations during the day this will exacerbate the problem.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Potholes</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-728\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-pot-hole-with-puddle-300x175.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-pot-hole-with-puddle\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"175\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Once a small fracture or crack appears in the surface, water and other grit can get in and they begin to erode the edges. Frost and temperature changes accelerate the process. As the crack becomes wider, the effect of vehicle tyres crushes the edges and gradually the pothole becomes wider. Pieces around the edges become dislodged and removed by the action of vehicle tyres. They are usually repaired by filling them. Potholes can be deep enough to cause damage to vehicles, and they are dangerous for motorbikes.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Edge cracks</h3>\\r\\n<p><img class=\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-729\\\" src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tarmac-transverse-cracking-300x167.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tarmac-transverse-cracking\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" height=\\\"167\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>If there is an issue with subsidence on the edges of the roads, edge cracks will appear. It can be accelerated (or caused) by heavy traffic that uses the shoulders of the road such as agricultural machinery. If &nbsp;the road is bordered by vegetation such as grass, this will also break up the tarmac. A weak surface layer or base and poor drainage and/or frost will only make things worse.</p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode/car/signs/43/\\\">Test your knowledge of road code signs by taking our free quiz here</a>.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"gravel-road-surface.gif\",\"audioName\":\"416.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"loose-road-surface\",\"canonical\":\"resources/road-maintenance-and-driving-around-roadworks/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1492,\"title\":\"To avoid splashing others with water\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:59.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1493,\"title\":\"Your tyres may suffer a blow-out\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:59.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1494,\"title\":\"There is a road gritter ahead\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:59.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1495,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"To avoid throwing up loose chippings\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:59.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":416,\"correct_text\":\"This sign warns of a loose road surface that can cause chippings to fly out from your tyres and cause damage to other vehicles, or injury to pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.

If this was a controlled intersection then you'd have to either stop at a stop sign or wait at a give way sign until it was safe to go.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q173b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"248\\\" height=\\\"155\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are driving straight ahead in the blue car across the top of the T-intersection.

In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction. At a controlled intersection you would either be waiting at a stop sign or a give way sign.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q175b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The red car is coming from straight ahead and you are turning right therefore you must let it past before you can turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q176b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Even though the red car is on the right, it is waiting at a give way sign and you are passing straight through the junction.

This used to be the rule in New Zealand until it was changed in 2012. Now, you have the right of way and can turn before the red car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q178b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning right and so is the red car. Which one gives way? The red car is on the bottom of the T-intersection (imagine rotating the picture 90 degrees clockwise). You are driving on the top of the T therefore you can go.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q179b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning left and there's a red car coming from your right along the road.

It's an uncontrolled intersection and both of you are travelling straight ahead. Who has to give way? The rules are that you give way to the right when there are no other controls like a stop sign, therefore the red car must stop and wait for you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q187b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Remember our stop sign rule. At an uncontrolled intersection or one where you were both waiting at a give way sign, you would have right of way. However, you are waiting at a stop sign and that means that the red car has priority, even though it's turning across in front of you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q192b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>When both cars are turning right at an uncontrolled intersection (which includes many driveways and entrances to public car parks that don't have markings), you must give way to vehicles on the straight road (i.e. the top of the T).

On the west entrance (bottom left) there is a feeder lane onto the motorway on-ramp, and two other lanes. There are two lanes at the exit to the east (top right). At the entrance to the roundabout from the east (top right) there are three lanes of which the right hand one turns right and the other two go straight ahead. There's also a feeder lane on to the motorway going south.</p>\\r\\n<p>The motorway off-ramp heading north has two lanes: one has an arrow to the right and the other an arrow to the left. There's no arrow straight on because that will take you back onto the motorway and it would be highly unusual to do that (i.e. only if you'd made a mistake, in which case you wouldn't want to confuse other drivers on the roundabout. The same applies at the off-ramp heading south at the top of the picture. Because of these off-ramps, the roundabout is only one lane wide on the east and west, but two lanes wide on the north and three lanes wide on the south.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>At position 1 there is a dashed line showing that the inside lane of the two lanes can split into either a third lane which will continue turning right, or the middle lane which will exit onto Greenlane towards the west.</p>\\r\\n<p>At point 2 you can see that those two lanes exit onto Greenlane to the west and vehicles stay in the respective lanes on the roundabout.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/greenlane-motorway-roundabout.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Roundabout at Greenlane, Auckland\\\" width=\\\"630\\\" height=\\\"429\\\" /></p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"roundabout-sign.gif\",\"audioName\":\"422.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"roundabout-ahead\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/road-position/what-must-you-do-when-turning-right-at-a/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1516,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"Roundabout ahead\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1517,\"title\":\"Recycling centre ahead\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1518,\"title\":\"Two way traffic ahead\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1519,\"title\":\"Merging traffic ahead\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":422,\"correct_text\":\"This sign gives warning that a roundabout is ahead.\",\"incorrect_text\":\"This sign gives warning that a roundabout is ahead.\",\"correct_image_name\":null,\"incorrect_image_name\":null,\"correct_video\":null,\"incorrect_video\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:43.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},\"section\":\"car\"},{\"id\":221,\"title\":\"What colour flashing lights do maintenance vehicles use?\",\"description\":\"<h1>Vehicle warning lights</h1>\\r\\n<h2>Maintenance vehicle lights</h2>\\r\\n<p>Maintenance vehicles use orange flashing lights usually on the vehicle's cab, but in the case of larger vehicles they are often on the rear, too.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/traffic-management-truck-night-orange-lights.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"maintenance vehicle with flashing lights\\\" width=\\\"600\\\" height=\\\"362\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<h2>Pilot vehicle lights</h2>\\r\\n<p>You can see in the video below that the vehicle behind the load (in this case, a house on the back of a truck), has flashing yellow lights.

Select all that apply\",\"description\":\"<h1>The Give Way Rules in New Zealand</h1>\\r\\n<p>Let's look at a number of examples of giving way which can help you determine what to do at many kinds of intersections in New Zealand (and around the world). If you've been confused about the rules before, these simple examples will help you learn them easily.</p>\\r\\n<p>The basic give way rules are:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Give way to your right at roundabouts</li>\\r\\n<li>Give way to vehicles coming from straight ahead if you are turning right</li>\\r\\n<li>Give way to vehicles turning left if you are turning right</li>\\r\\n<li>Give way to all vehicles on the top of a T-intersection if you are on the bottom of the T</li>\\r\\n<li>A driveway is treated like an uncontrolled intersection</li>\\r\\n<li>If you deviate from the centre line, generally you have to give way</li>\\r\\n<li>At a stop sign, you have the least priority and all other vehicles have the right of way before you, unless they are at stop signs, too, in which case the give way rules apply</li>\\r\\n<li>A police officer's directions overrule any give way or stop signs.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<h2>Intersection examples</h2>\\r\\n<p>In all examples, let's look at it from the point of view of you driving the blue car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q172b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"248\\\" height=\\\"155\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are&nbsp;turning out of an uncontrolled intersection and must give way to the red car coming from the right. If this was a controlled intersection then you'd have to either stop at a stop sign or wait at a give way sign until it was safe to go.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q173b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"248\\\" height=\\\"155\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are driving straight ahead in the blue car across the top of the T-intersection. The red car has to give way to you because it is turning right across your path.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q174b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"248\\\" height=\\\"155\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>While the general rule is give way to the right at an uncontrolled intersection, that only applies at a crossroads. In this case, you are on the bottom of the T, and the red car has right of way as it is coming across the top of the T-junction. At a controlled intersection you would either be waiting at a stop sign or a give way sign.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q175b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The red car is coming from straight ahead and you are turning right therefore you must let it past before you can turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q176b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Even though the red car is on the right, it is waiting at a give way sign and you are passing straight through the junction. Therefore you have the right of way. The same would apply if it was waiting at a stop sign.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q177b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning left and the red car is turning right and would have to cross your path. This used to be the rule in New Zealand until it was changed in 2012. Now, you have the right of way and can turn before the red car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q178b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning right and so is the red car. Which one gives way? The red car is on the bottom of the T-intersection (imagine rotating the picture 90 degrees clockwise). You are driving on the top of the T therefore you can go.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q179b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You are turning left and there's a red car coming from your right along the road. You have to wait because you are on the bottom of the T.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q182b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>This is a tricky one. It's an uncontrolled intersection and both of you are travelling straight ahead. Who has to give way? The rules are that you give way to the right when there are no other controls like a stop sign, therefore the red car must stop and wait for you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q187b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Remember our stop sign rule. At an uncontrolled intersection or one where you were both waiting at a give way sign, you would have right of way. However, you are waiting at a stop sign and that means that the red car has priority, even though it's turning across in front of you.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q192b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>When both cars are turning right at an uncontrolled intersection (which includes many driveways and entrances to public car parks that don't have markings), you must give way to vehicles on the straight road (i.e. the top of the T). The blue car has right of way - the red car must wait for you to turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q193b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Even though you have a green light, so does the red car, and it is heading straight through the intersection while you want to turn, therefore you have to wait.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q194b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You both have a green light, but because you are turning left you can go first.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q196b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>You both have a green light but the motorbike is turning left, therefore you must wait for it before you can turn.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q197b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In this scenario neither car needs to cross each other's path. Both are on a green light. If this was an uncontrolled intersection this manoeuvre is actually safer when the cars pass behind one another rather than in front. This is because when passing like in the diagram, your vision up the road to the left is obscured.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q198b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>On a roundabout you always give way to the right, so you have to wait for the red car.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q199b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The red car must give way to you as you are coming from its right, passing straight through the roundabout.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"../../../../../../../media/question-images/q200b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>In this case you are deviating from the centre line, even though you want to drive straight ahead.

High-sided vehicles are more likely to tip over on sharp corners.</p>\\r\\n<p>NZTA has guidelines for whether a corner requires these signs, what size they should be and how far before the curve they should be situated.</p>\\r\\n<p>The signs are from 15-95kph in 10kph increments. This way you can tell between speed limit signs and advisory signs. Read more about <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/the-difference-between-speed-limits-and-suggested-speeds/\\\">speed limits vs advisory speeds here</a>. A 35kph sign covers the range 31-41kph.</p>\\r\\n<p>The figure is measured by driving a vehicle around the curve at a constant speed and measuring the lateral forces acting on the vehicle using a side thrust gauge. Two runs that yield the same result must be made for a sign to be adopted.</p>\\r\\n<p>The speed set for the curve is 15kph less than the 85th percentile curve approach speed for speed of 30-60kph, i.e. the speed at which the top 15% of traffic would approach the curve, i.e. the speed just before the traffic begins to slow down. Therefore if the sign says 15kph then the 85% percentile is travelling at 30kph. For speeds of 80-90kph the advisory speed is 25kph less. For 110-130kph the advisory speed is 35kph less. These speed guidelines were set in the 1990s and are now out-of-date because overall speeds are lower and vehicle capabilities are higher. Although this doesn't stop surprisingly frequent rollovers of heavy vehicles each year through misjudging the corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signs are placed at least 120m ahead of the curve in rural areas and 60m ahead of the curve in urban areas.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p><img style=\\\"float: left;\\\" src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/120px-New_Zealand_PW-25_75_kmh.svg_.png\\\" alt=\\\"75 advisory speed\\\" width=\\\"120\\\" height=\\\"80\\\" />Suggested or advisory speeds are always found ending in 5. They are almost always for cornering and are either in a yellow rectangle, or attached to chevrons.</p>\\r\\n<p>The speeds are set using a formula based on measured speed before the corner and not actually what vehicles are capable of. For example, as you approach a tight left hand bend it might be signposted 45kph. Drive the other way and it becomes a right-hand bend and might be signposted 45 to 65kph (depending on the angle, camber and visibility).</p>\\r\\n<p>This suggests a comfortable speed in dry weather, but not necessarily what an experienced driver would take the corner at. As a learner driver, it&rsquo;s advised to stick to these speeds until you understand whether your vehicle is capable of more, you have better judgement, and you know that particular road. Cornering is all about taking the right line, and taking the wrong line on a corner with an advisory speed could mean that you go off the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>If it is wet, exercise more caution, particularly if you see signs such as &lsquo;Slippery when wet&rsquo; on the approach to the corner.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/New_Zealand_Sign_Assembly_-_Road_Slippery_When_Wet.svg_.png\\\" alt=\\\"slippery when wet sign\\\" width=\\\"80\\\" height=\\\"119\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>The sign below indicates that the priority route has a sharp right-hand turn with an advisory speed of 35kph.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/35kph-right-turn.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"550\\\" height=\\\"329\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Because suggested speeds and regulatory speeds are always written differently and on different coloured signs, there&rsquo;s no chance of confusing them.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"35k-curve-sign.gif\",\"audioName\":\"73.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"what-does-this-sign-mean9\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/signs/what-does-this-sign-mean9/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":271,\"title\":\"A comfortable travelling speed around this corner is 35mph\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":272,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"A comfortable travelling speed around this corner is 35kph\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":273,\"title\":\"The corner is 35 metres long\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":274,\"title\":\"The corner has an angle of 35 degrees - the higher the number, the sharper the corner\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2018-07-22 18:38:51.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":73,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

They will usually ready between 50 and 55kph in order to allow for different tyre inflation and wear and the different angles of looking at the speedometer used by drivers of different heights. This inaccuracy protects automotive manufacturers from having to settle speeding ticket claims as the speedometer always over-reads. Additionally, speedometers are not allowed to under-read, therefore manufacturers err on the side of caution.

In the holiday season queues can form at these bridges on some roads.</p>\\r\\n<p>Edge lines form a taper to the bridge from the edges of the seal to the bridge carriageway width. This taper is ideally 50m long. Usually the lines stop when they reach the kerb of the bridge, painted in by about 300mm, unless there's sufficient room to effectively mark and maintain the lines (this is not as probable as the bridge already has restricted width, which is what it's a one-lane bridge).</p>\\r\\n<p>If the approaching roads have a centre line, this is marked up to the bridge, but not on the bridge itself. It's marked to a point where the width of the approach road narrows to less than 5m.</p>\\r\\n<p>There will be a give way line painted on the road with a white triangle. This doesn't have any legal significance, it's not compulsory you stop on the line or even behind the line, it's just a guideline. The give way line will be marked where the road is still at least 5m wide, and preferably 6m.</p>\\r\\n<p>Signs are placed at or before the line.</p>\\r\\n<p>The words ONE LANE BRIDGE are marked on the road. The distance of these from the bridge depends on the speed and type of road. In rural areas they must be at least 120m before the bridge, and in urban areas at least 60m before. The whole phrase is spread over 50m on the road.</p>\\r\\n<p>A single lane arrow can be used to remind drivers to stay on the left as they exit the bridge.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":\"one-lane-bridge-sign.jpg\",\"audioName\":\"77.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"when-coming-up-to-a-one-lane-bridge-what\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/signs/when-coming-up-to-a-one-lane-bridge-what/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 00:49:23.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":285,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"You've got right of way, if it's safe to proceed\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 08:46:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":286,\"title\":\"Other drivers have right of way and you have to stop\",\"image_name\":null,\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:16.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 08:46:46.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":77,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

If a police officer suspects that the vehicle you are driving might not be roadworthy they will pull you over and conduct a short test, plus check your driver licence and possibly do a breath screening test.

If you can't you must fit wing mirror extensions. This is often the case with wide caravans. Your car is likely to be between 1.6 and 1.9 metres wide and a caravan or large trailer can be up to 2.5m wide.</p>\\r\\n<p>The maximum distance between your vehicle and the one you are towing is 4 metres, and the maximum speed you are allowed to drive when towing a trailer or a vehicle with a rigid towing system on the open road is 90kph.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you want to tow a motorbike, it must be mechanically disabled and you must not exceed 30kph.</p>\\r\\n<p>Any towed vehicle must show at least one red light at the back, and if it is a disabled vehicle (i.e. you're towing a car, rather than a trailer or caravan), its headlights must light up the towing connection so that drivers overtaking know that it is being towed.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are towing a vehicle using a rope, you will need to travel slowly - the legal maximum is no more than 50kph - because the distance between your vehicle and the one behind is very short. Braking should be done gently and well in advance of any obstacle. You will need to ensure that the brakes of the vehicle behind you are functioning otherwise it won't be able to stop and will run into the back of you. If they don't function your option is to use a rigid towing system, load it onto a trailer or get a tow truck.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/roadcode-questions/car/behaviour/if-you-have-to-drive-at-a-slow-speed-tha/\\\">holding other traffic up</a>, pull over periodically to let them pass.

When not carrying a load on a roof rack, remove it so that your car is more aerodynamic.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your vehicle's manual will tell you how much you can safely carry on a roof rack. The roof rack manufacturer will specify the maximum load of the rack. You will also need to look for one that suits the shape and size of your vehicle. Not all vehicles can have roof racks fitted easily.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying loads on your roof rack your load must not extend more than 3 metres forward of the front edge of the front seat or four metres behind the rear axle. The maximum length of your car plus load must not exceed 12.6m.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/overhanging-load.gif\\\" alt=\\\"Overhanging loads\\\" width=\\\"402\\\" height=\\\"178\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>Distribute any load on the roof between the bars and centrally and make sure it is tied down well.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don't move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Arrange loads so that they don't project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).</p>\\r\\n<p>Heavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a motorbike</h2>\\r\\n<p>Small loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Of course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.</p>\\r\\n<p>For lower loads, be careful that they won't touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.</p>\\r\\n<p>The load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don't hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.</p>\\r\\n<p>Keeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.</p>\\r\\n<p>Distributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn't possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.</p>\\r\\n<p>Check the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn't moved.</p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing a trailer using your motorbike</h3>\\r\\n<p>If you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a light trailer</h2>\\r\\n<p>Loads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It's preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn't possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.</p>\\r\\n<p>The lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.</p>\\r\\n<p>Goods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won't injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.</p>\\r\\n<p>Position the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don't want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don't want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.</p>\\r\\n<p>This video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.</p>\\r\\n<p><iframe src=\\\"//www.youtube.com/embed/ZIuZ8BUhfew\\\" width=\\\"640\\\" height=\\\"350\\\"></iframe></p>\\r\\n<h3>Towing capacity</h3>\\r\\n<p>Your vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.</p>\\r\\n<p>For more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand/\\\">guide to towing loads</a>, or visit <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">NZTA's guide to safe towing</a>.</p>\\r\\n<h2>Carrying loads on a heavy vehicle</h2>\\r\\n<p>Check out our main article about <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">carrying loads in heavy vehicles</a>&nbsp;as there are many more regulations.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"436.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"night-time-towing-lights\",\"canonical\":\"resources/carrying-loads-on-a-car-motorbike-or-trailer/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:11.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":1571,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"A red light\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:57.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1572,\"title\":\"A white light\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:57.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1573,\"title\":\"A yellow light\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:57.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":1574,\"title\":\"A flashing red light\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:57.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":436,\"correct_text\":\"Correct.

If a police officer suspects that the vehicle you are driving might not be roadworthy they will pull you over and conduct a short test, plus check your driver licence and possibly do a breath screening test. They might also conduct the test if you've been pulled over for a traffic offence such as speeding or driving inconsiderately.</p>\\r\\n<p>It's not a <a href=\\\"../../../../../../../roadcode-questions/car/theory/warrant-of-fitness-renewal-and-rules/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Warrant of Fitness</a>&nbsp;test. For minor infringements police will usually be lenient and offer 'traffic compliance' if you are polite and compliant, for example if your Warrant has only just expired. They will help advise you how to get the item fixed and why.</p>\\r\\n<p>The seven main areas they will check are tyres - looking for the tread depth and general condition plus inflation level. If your vehicle is modified and has extra camber, then your tyres can wear on the inside more quickly. Indicator blocks in the tread will show where the tread depth is less than 1.5mm.</p>\\r\\n<p>They will check the lights work and aren't obscured, e.g. not covered by tape. Indicator, park, brake and headlights must work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Obvious rust patches in structural areas could be cause for concern, and could mean the vehicle isn't roadworthy. There must not be any loose or damaged parts.</p>\\r\\n<p>The windscreen should not have any cracks and damage in the critical vision area.</p>\\r\\n<p>Your wipers must work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mirrors should be present and not damaged. Vehicles made after 2000 must have both wing mirrors and a rear-view mirror. Vehicles made before 2000 must have either a rear view mirror or a wing mirror on the driver's side.</p>\\r\\n<p>Safety belts must not be damaged or overly faded and the buckles must work correctly.</p>\\r\\n<p>Correct child restraints must be in the vehicle for any children under 8 years old.</p>\\r\\n<p>The exhaust system is checked for leaks and smoke.

The defects must be repaired</p>\\r\\n<p>If the defects are major, it might be green-stickered. Conditions for driving the vehicle will be given. A new WoF isn't required if it's a simple fix, but the police may require you to prove you've fixed it. Otherwise, a new Warrant of Fitness will be required.</p>\\r\\n<p>If the defects are serious, the vehicle is unsafe and will be pink-stickered. It must not be driven, and must be fixed immediately. A new WoF will be issued.</p>\\r\\n<p>If you have already been pulled over for a specific issue, or you have significant problems then police might fine you. Just remember: be courteous and polite and offer solutions to the officer rather than making life difficult for them.

Tread can be designed for seasonal variations in weather, for performance, or for convenience.</p>\\r\\n<p>Tyre markings on the side of the tyre tell you what the size is and what it's designed for.</p>\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tyre-size-marking.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"tyre size marking\\\" width=\\\"500\\\" height=\\\"207\\\" /></p>\\r\\n<p>A generic all-weather tyre will have a mixture of lugs (blocks) and grooves. It will provide a good compromise between dry weather and wet weather driving. Wide grooves will help resist aquaplaning and will channel the water towards the edge of the tyre. If a tyre has M+S on the sidewall it is designed for light mud and snow driving, too.</p>\\r\\n<p>If a tyre is a performance tyre, it is more likely to be directional, i.e. the tyre can only be used on one side, and made of a software compound.</p>\\r\\n<p>Tyres for off road have wider grooves and deeper blocks that shed mud more easily giving more grip on softer surfaces. Extreme off-road tyres have grooves that open onto the shoulder of the tyre giving even more traction on muddy and rocky surfaces. Tyres like these have much more resistance to punctures, but are less capable on the road at higher speeds because the blocks move around more under the forces of cornering.</p>\\r\\n<p>You can see an excellent explanation of the different types of pattern on <a href=\\\"http://global.yokohamatire.net/technology/tireknowledge/treadpatterns.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Yokohama's site here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Read our article about <a href=\\\"https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/caring-for-your-tyres/\\\">caring for your tyres here</a>.</p>\",\"input_type\":\"Radio\",\"image_name\":null,\"audioName\":\"194.mp3\",\"video\":null,\"permalink\":\"what-is-the-minimum-tread-depth-required\",\"canonical\":\"roadcode-questions/car/theory/what-is-the-minimum-tread-depth-required/\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:11.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"answers\":[{\"id\":654,\"title\":\"1mm\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:56.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":655,\"title\":\"1.25mm\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:56.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":656,\"isCorrect\":true,\"title\":\"1.5mm\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:56.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}},{\"id\":657,\"title\":\"2mm\",\"image_name\":\"\",\"created\":{\"date\":\"2016-10-28 13:59:17.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"},\"updated\":{\"date\":\"2017-12-01 03:30:56.000000\",\"timezone_type\":3,\"timezone\":\"Pacific/Auckland\"}}],\"question_hint\":{\"id\":194,\"correct_text\":\"Correct. 1.5mm is the minimum tread depth required for car tyres to get a Warrant of Fitness.
