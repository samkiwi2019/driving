This is because the animal\u0027s blind spot is behind its head and it runs away from \u0027danger\u0027. If it turns around it sees an object coming towards it.

High-sided vehicles are more likely to tip over on sharp corners.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENZTA has guidelines for whether a corner requires these signs, what size they should be and how far before the curve they should be situated.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe signs are from 15-95kph in 10kph increments. This way you can tell between speed limit signs and advisory signs.

A 35kph sign covers the range 31-41kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe figure is measured by driving a vehicle around the curve at a constant speed and measuring the lateral forces acting on the vehicle using a side thrust gauge. Two runs that yield the same result must be made for a sign to be adopted.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe speed set for the curve is 15kph less than the 85th percentile curve approach speed for speed of 30-60kph, i.e. the speed at which the top 15% of traffic would approach the curve, i.e. the speed just before the traffic begins to slow down. Therefore if the sign says 15kph then the 85% percentile is travelling at 30kph. For speeds of 80-90kph the advisory speed is 25kph less. For 110-130kph the advisory speed is 35kph less. These speed guidelines were set in the 1990s and are now out-of-date because overall speeds are lower and vehicle capabilities are higher. Although this doesn\u0027t stop surprisingly frequent rollovers of heavy vehicles each year through misjudging the corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESigns are placed at least 120m ahead of the curve in rural areas and 60m ahead of the curve in urban areas.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg style=\u0022float: left;\u0022 src=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/120px-New_Zealand_PW-25_75_kmh.svg_.png\u0022 alt=\u002275 advisory speed\u0022 width=\u0022120\u0022 height=\u002280\u0022 \/\u003ESuggested or advisory speeds are always found ending in 5. They are almost always for cornering and are either in a yellow rectangle, or attached to chevrons.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe speeds are set using a formula based on measured speed before the corner and not actually what vehicles are capable of. For example, as you approach a tight left hand bend it might be signposted 45kph. Drive the other way and it becomes a right-hand bend and might be signposted 45 to 65kph (depending on the angle, camber and visibility).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis suggests a comfortable speed in dry weather, but not necessarily what an experienced driver would take the corner at. As a learner driver, it\u0026rsquo;s advised to stick to these speeds until you understand whether your vehicle is capable of more, you have better judgement, and you know that particular road. Cornering is all about taking the right line, and taking the wrong line on a corner with an advisory speed could mean that you go off the road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it is wet, exercise more caution, particularly if you see signs such as \u0026lsquo;Slippery when wet\u0026rsquo; on the approach to the corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/New_Zealand_Sign_Assembly_-_Road_Slippery_When_Wet.svg_.png\u0022 alt=\u0022slippery when wet sign\u0022 width=\u002280\u0022 height=\u0022119\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe sign below indicates that the priority route has a sharp right-hand turn with an advisory speed of 35kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/35kph-right-turn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022 width=\u0022550\u0022 height=\u0022329\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause suggested speeds and regulatory speeds are always written differently and on different coloured signs, there\u0026rsquo;s no chance of confusing them.\u003C\/p\u003E",

There are thousands of near misses each year with vehicles and pedestrians trying to get across tracks before the train comes. Because a train is huge, it\u0027s estimated that people\u0027s perception of its speed is 10-20kph less than its actual speed. This means the train can be bearing down on you much more rapidly than you thought.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere must be room the other side of the tracks for your vehicle.

In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit.

More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase.

If you are in a queue of traffic and you are all moving at the same speed, the driver behind you will not make much extra progress just by overtaking you.

More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road.

Children have notoriously short attention spans, and always seem to be needing to stop to go to the toilet.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026rsquo;s better to have someone else in the car with you to take on the role of keeping the kids occupied. Or encourage them to go to sleep. If they are OK reading or using an iPad or similar, let them do that. There is some evidence that if you tell a child not to read because it will make them travel sick that you then create this behaviour in them. Begin by telling them it\u0027s OK to read, then take it easy in the corners so you don\u0027t throw them about too much.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EPets\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA pet in the front seat has the potential to be a distraction. You should never ride with your dog or cat in your lap. They should be either in a proper pet enclosure (like a cat cage) or you can let them ride in the boot if you have a station wagon. Bear in mind that if you have to stop quickly, Fluffy will become a heavy, claw-equipped projectile in your car which could damage you and seriously injure or kill it. Pet stores sell various devices for restraining your pet in your car.

Newer cars come with buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to keep your hands on the wheel while adjusting the volume or channel, like in the Volkswagen Golf GTI steering wheel on the left. In an older car make sure you tune your presets before setting off then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to play around with trying to find the right frequency.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESatellite navigation systems can provide a similar distraction. If you want to enter a destination in, whether you have a built-in sat nav or an external third-party one either as a standalone unit or on your phone, get someone else in the car to do it, or pull over.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAdjusting the climate control is another distraction that may cause you to take your eyes off the road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EVisual distractions\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lsquo;Road furniture\u0026rsquo; is constantly vying for your attention. Road furniture (or street furniture in some countries) is the term that describes items such as fire hydrants, benches, road signs, traffic lights, streetlamps kerbstones and other items that form the road environment.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERoad signs are instructional, however, some European and Scandinavian towns have dramatically reduced the number of signs and have found that people drive more carefully and the accident rate drops.

The whole purpose of these signs is to distract you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGovernments are interested in reducing sign clutter and there are local bylaws that prevent some kinds of signs.

It\u0026rsquo;s hot, you put it in your lap, and are we really designed to handle food and drive at the same time? Major culprits for causing accidents through distraction are hot fillings scalding the driver, or spilling liquids.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you know you will want to eat on the journey pack food and drink that is convenient to eat with one hand \u0026ndash; i.e. food that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need two hands to open or consume. Or, stop on the side of the road and take a break while eating as it\u0026rsquo;s more refreshing for your body.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EPhones\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it\u0026rsquo;s illegal in New Zealand to use a hand-held phone to make a call. It\u0026rsquo;s also illegal to send or read a text message while driving. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop the phone from being a distraction, though. Even if you are using a hands-free kit, talking on the phone makes you around 1.3 times more likely to crash.

More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit.

More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road.

When not carrying a load on a roof rack, remove it so that your car is more aerodynamic.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle\u0027s manual will tell you how much you can safely carry on a roof rack. The roof rack manufacturer will specify the maximum load of the rack. You will also need to look for one that suits the shape and size of your vehicle. Not all vehicles can have roof racks fitted easily.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying loads on your roof rack your load must not extend more than 3 metres forward of the front edge of the front seat or four metres behind the rear axle.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don\u0027t move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EArrange loads so that they don\u0027t project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHeavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a motorbike\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor lower loads, be careful that they won\u0027t touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don\u0027t hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDistributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn\u0027t possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn\u0027t moved.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing a trailer using your motorbike\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a light trailer\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELoads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It\u0027s preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn\u0027t possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGoods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won\u0027t injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPosition the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don\u0027t want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don\u0027t want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZIuZ8BUhfew\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022350\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing capacity\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022\u003Eguide to towing loads\u003C\/a\u003E, or visit \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ENZTA\u0027s guide to safe towing\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a heavy vehicle\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out our main article about \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecarrying loads in heavy vehicles\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;as there are many more regulations.\u003C\/p\u003E",

This means you should use the four-second rule - count four seconds between a point on the road that the car in front passes until you pass that point. If you\u0027re driving a heavy vehicle or towing a large trailer, you should increase this time further. If you are riding a motorbike be aware that white lines can be extremely slippery when wet, and any oil and surface grime will lengthen your braking distance.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone is following you closely, you might want to back off even more to give some extra buffer.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA vehicle ahead of you will kick up spray if the rain has been heavy.

Mist is similar to fog, but visibility remains above 1km.

Also, use a rear fog light, but only until the fog clears as it can dazzle other drivers.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have front fog lights (they are usually low-mounted lights in your bumper), use them.

As well as increasing your following distance to 4-5 seconds from the usual 2 seconds, it can help to use the air conditioning and the rear demister to keep windows clear. If water collects on your screen you can use the wipers but bear in mind that there might not be enough water to warrant using the wipers continuously.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are driving in rural areas there may be wildlife on the road.

The red band is designed to be fade-resistant.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe retroreflective strips in either white or yellow are applied with adhesive. The post itself is between 90-110mm and when they are inserted into the ground they are at least 800mm tall.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don\u0027t move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EArrange loads so that they don\u0027t project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHeavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a motorbike\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor lower loads, be careful that they won\u0027t touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don\u0027t hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDistributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn\u0027t possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn\u0027t moved.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing a trailer using your motorbike\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg.

It\u0027s preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn\u0027t possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGoods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won\u0027t injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPosition the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don\u0027t want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don\u0027t want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZIuZ8BUhfew\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022350\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing capacity\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022\u003Eguide to towing loads\u003C\/a\u003E, or visit \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ENZTA\u0027s guide to safe towing\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a heavy vehicle\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out our main article about \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecarrying loads in heavy vehicles\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;as there are many more regulations.\u003C\/p\u003E",

As they are controlled, the controllers will wait until a number of children have arrived before allowing the group to cross, rather than just have a pedestrian crossing with children crossing as they arrive, which holds up traffic more frequently.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe stop signs provide an added safety feature to protect children that might just step into the crossing without waiting for vehicles to stop for them.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs these crossings are sometimes almost exclusively used by school children, they are infrequently used through the day. Drivers who frequent the route can become used to there never being anyone on the crossing.

A typical yellow light in an urban area lasts for approximately four seconds. We timed several downtown Auckland lights to come up with an average of 3.8 seconds. In the UK, yellow lights are 1 second per 10mph (16kph) speed limit.

More roads joining the intersection will mean a longer red phase. A minor road entering a major intersection could have a very short green phase because there might only ever be one or two vehicles waiting at any one time, whereas a large intersection with a main road travelling through it could see very long green phases on the main road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPhases can be altered by detecting vehicles at an intersection using a magnetic induction loop in the road.

Let\u0027s take a look at the hazards.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn general, this is an intersection with good visibility. There\u0027s nothing on the pavement to hide pedestrians, and the road is clear with no islands or crossings. There\u0027s no signage shown that could be distracting.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EContrast it with the junction in this photo where there are vehicles waiting over the road in an intersection with poor visibility, a pedestrian waiting on the left, a deep shadow making it more difficult to see the Fiat on the right, and a roadworks sign. What you can\u0027t see in this photo is that there\u0027s a bus stop just around to the left, and a busy supermarket with many pedestrians crossing the road and waiting in the centre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/stop-junction.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Complex staggered crossroads with shadows\u0022 width=\u0022550\u0022 height=\u0022367\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBack to our original intersection diagram:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicle A is turning left onto the opposite side of the road and you are almost at the turning, therefore A does not cause a hazard.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicle B is partially obscured by vehicle D, but is unlikely to manoeuvre to cause you any problems. The only problem vehicle B could cause is to hit D from behind. As D\u0027s wheels are already turned towards the driveway, this will shunt D into your path. This is a reason why when you are waiting to turn across a lane you should keep your wheels facing forward. It\u0027s better to be shunted into the back of a car in front than across into the path of traffic coming the other way.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicle C would only be a hazard if it had to stop suddenly and there\u0027s no indication that that would happen in this diagram.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the driver of D on the other side of the road, turning right into the driveway, may misjudge the distance between you and car C. You should be prepared to slow down or stop.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, an advanced driver would notice that this is an older car - a Volkswagen Beetle. It\u0027s likely to have slower acceleration. It will almost certainly be a manual gearbox and therefore the driver could stall it half way through the turn.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing advanced drivers will look out for is the age of the driver of the other vehicle. Very young drivers are likely to be impetuous and lack skill in judging distances, whereas older drivers could have less visual acuity and perhaps slower reactions.\u003C\/p\u003E",

You can see this in the image below of the Thames Coast Road. In the dark, there is no lighting on this road and there are plenty of corners, so the road markers help define the road\u0026rsquo;s direction ahead.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe markers themselves are plastic, flexible, high-gloss white strips that are designed to be durable enough to last 10 years. Because they are flexible they present a minimal hazard if they\u0026rsquo;re hit by a vehicle. The red band is designed to be fade-resistant.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe retroreflective strips in either white or yellow are applied with adhesive. The post itself is between 90-110mm and when they are inserted into the ground they are at least 800mm tall.

This means a debt registered against a licence plate\u0026nbsp;that\u0026nbsp;has been changed from the original one when the debt was first lodged against it.\u0026nbsp;You should be able to get a history of the vehicle\u0027s licence plates.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicle clocking, where the odometer is wound back, is still common. Vehicles can also be imported damaged (which could mean fire and flood damage, or structural damage) and repaired. Two vehicles can be joined together (\u0027cut and shut\u0027), and other issues.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome vehicles are stolen and immediately offered for sale before the owner has a chance to register them as stolen. A free stolen car check is available on \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/checka.co.nz\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Evehicle history websites\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA full vehicle history report will include whether the vehicle is fully licenced and registered - if it isn\u0027t, you might be liable to pay backdated licence fees. The licence could have been cancelled, and if it has a report should say why. The current registration status will be shown, as well as the origin of the registration and when it was first registered in New Zealand. If it was first registered overseas, the report will show which country and when.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the vehicle allowed to be driven on the road? The Warrant of Fitness status will be displayed, and when it passed its last inspection, along with the latest details including the odometer reading. A report might give you an estimated odometer reading which can be useful if the last check was more than a few months ago.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ownership history, including how many owners, will be displayed. You won\u0027t be able to get name and address details on individual owners unless they have a debt registered against the vehicle, but you will be able to find out details of non-individual owners such as companies.\u003C\/p\u003E",

The same applies at the off-ramp heading south at the top of the picture.

When not carrying a load on a roof rack, remove it so that your car is more aerodynamic.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle\u0027s manual will tell you how much you can safely carry on a roof rack. The roof rack manufacturer will specify the maximum load of the rack. You will also need to look for one that suits the shape and size of your vehicle. Not all vehicles can have roof racks fitted easily.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying loads on your roof rack your load must not extend more than 3 metres forward of the front edge of the front seat or four metres behind the rear axle.

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don\u0027t move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EArrange loads so that they don\u0027t project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHeavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a motorbike\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor lower loads, be careful that they won\u0027t touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don\u0027t hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDistributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn\u0027t possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn\u0027t moved.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing a trailer using your motorbike\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a light trailer\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELoads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It\u0027s preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn\u0027t possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGoods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won\u0027t injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPosition the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don\u0027t want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don\u0027t want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZIuZ8BUhfew\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022350\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing capacity\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022\u003Eguide to towing loads\u003C\/a\u003E, or visit \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ENZTA\u0027s guide to safe towing\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a heavy vehicle\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out our main article about \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecarrying loads in heavy vehicles\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;as there are many more regulations.\u003C\/p\u003E",

The red band is designed to be fade-resistant.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe retroreflective strips in either white or yellow are applied with adhesive. The post itself is between 90-110mm and when they are inserted into the ground they are at least 800mm tall.

Children have notoriously short attention spans, and always seem to be needing to stop to go to the toilet.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0026rsquo;s better to have someone else in the car with you to take on the role of keeping the kids occupied. Or encourage them to go to sleep. If they are OK reading or using an iPad or similar, let them do that. There is some evidence that if you tell a child not to read because it will make them travel sick that you then create this behaviour in them. Begin by telling them it\u0027s OK to read, then take it easy in the corners so you don\u0027t throw them about too much.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EPets\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA pet in the front seat has the potential to be a distraction. You should never ride with your dog or cat in your lap. They should be either in a proper pet enclosure (like a cat cage) or you can let them ride in the boot if you have a station wagon. Bear in mind that if you have to stop quickly, Fluffy will become a heavy, claw-equipped projectile in your car which could damage you and seriously injure or kill it. Pet stores sell various devices for restraining your pet in your car.

Newer cars come with buttons on the steering wheel that allow you to keep your hands on the wheel while adjusting the volume or channel, like in the Volkswagen Golf GTI steering wheel on the left. In an older car make sure you tune your presets before setting off then you don\u0026rsquo;t need to play around with trying to find the right frequency.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESatellite navigation systems can provide a similar distraction. If you want to enter a destination in, whether you have a built-in sat nav or an external third-party one either as a standalone unit or on your phone, get someone else in the car to do it, or pull over.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAdjusting the climate control is another distraction that may cause you to take your eyes off the road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EVisual distractions\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lsquo;Road furniture\u0026rsquo; is constantly vying for your attention.

The whole purpose of these signs is to distract you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGovernments are interested in reducing sign clutter and there are local bylaws that prevent some kinds of signs.

Major culprits for causing accidents through distraction are hot fillings scalding the driver, or spilling liquids.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you know you will want to eat on the journey pack food and drink that is convenient to eat with one hand \u0026ndash; i.e. food that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need two hands to open or consume.

It\u0026rsquo;s also illegal to send or read a text message while driving. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop the phone from being a distraction, though.

For example, if another vehicle is following you very closely be very careful about turning into driveways as it\u0027s easy for them to not be paying attention and run into the back of you. You can start slowing down more quickly to help them adjust their speed. As you turn, you can also glance in your rear view mirror to check there\u0027s nothing bearing down on you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECheck twice for bikes\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou will check to your right and ahead, too.

Many minor nose-to-tail accidents happen when a driver moves forward and then quickly stops. The driver behind sees the driver ahead move forwards and also starts to move forwards.

Some cars, like later model Holdens with MyLink, will interface directly with Pandora and Stitcher music apps so you can control them from the car\u0027s touchscreen. Then we\u0027ve got streaming music via Bluetooth and the plethora of radio stations. Some cars come with USB inputs for memory sticks, an input for an SD card and even a local hard disk. If you don\u0027t have that, you can plug your headphones into your phone or MP3 player. All this choice for music means that your car is probably more powerful and fully featured than the stereo you have at home.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBut does music enhance your driving or distract from it?\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve listened to music in cars for decades but do we know whether the\u0026nbsp;type music has much effect? In accident statistics we know that \u0027changing the radio\u0027 is a common cause of accidents (and that includes fiddling with any type of controls, swapping discs or searching through MP3 files), but how many near misses are caused by us absentmindedly humming along to One Direction on the radio on a road with two directions, and how many are as a result of us deliberately choosing a specific type of music which changes our emotions and aggression?\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2013 a study by Brodsky and Slor assessed \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001457513002509\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eteen driver behaviour when listening to music\u003C\/a\u003E and its risk factors. 85 young novice drivers with an average age of 17, all of whom had passed their test within the last 7 months, completed six trips in an instrumented learners vehicle. All participants committed at least 3 driver deficiencies; 27 needed a verbal warning\/command and 17 required a steering or braking intervention to prevent an accident. Deficiencies were things like speeding, failing to indicate, failing to check blind spots, tailgating, and so on.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big finding, though, was that if the music was selected by the driver it increased the mood and enjoyment of the drive but it also produced the most frequent severe driver miscalculations and inaccuracies, violations and aggressive driving. However, other music didn\u0027t necessarily have the same effect. The study used music on some trips that was structurally designed to generate moderate levels of perceptual complexity, and this music actually increased driver safety and improved behaviour!\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor journeys where the drivers got to choose the music, the most popular choice was dance\/electronica. The drivers also had to complete a drive without music and with music supplied by the researchers.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe choice of their own music appeared to increase the level of distraction.\u0026nbsp;This could be because it made an emotional connection with the driver and it ceased to be a background noise. The music supplied by the researchers ended up being safer than no music at all.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe study was only done on 85 drivers, all of which were novices, so we can\u0027t draw any inferences about behaviour in the general population. After only have driven a short time, the neural networks that make certain tasks automatic haven\u0027t formed that strongly with driving, and therefore the mental capacity needed to drive is quite possibly a higher percentage than for drivers that have 10 or 20 years of experience.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people say that music helps keep them more alert on a longer journey - i.e. it prevents boredom. But, as we found out in \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/how-distracting-is-talking-on-a-mobile-phone-when-driving\/\u0022\u003Ethis article about talking to passengers\u003C\/a\u003E, any kind of distraction usually makes your driving worse.\u003C\/p\u003E",

Oversteer is most easily caused by too much power applied through the rear wheels, but most cars are now front-wheel drive which means the only type of oversteer there\u0027s a risk of is likely to be caused by braking or lifting off the throttle in the middle of a corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving different tyres can cause oversteer. For example, if the rear tyres are worn more than the front tyres, oversteer is more likely in wet weather because the rear tyres won\u0027t displace water as effectively from the road. If the rear tyres are a harder rubber compound than the front tyres, the front tyres will grip relatively well in relation to the rear tyres. Different tread patterns can also affect overall grip.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMotorcyclists have to be more aware of oversteer as it can lead to a \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/highside-and-lowside-motorcycle-crashes-explained-video\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ehighside or lowside crash\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHeavy vehicle drivers don\u0027t usually have enough instantly available power to spin the rear wheels and cause oversteer. However, there are scenarios where it can occur. If the road is very slippery, the torque of the engine can overcome the grip available from the tyres. If there is a tail-heavy load the lateral g-forces can exceed the tyres\u0027 grip.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a heavy vehicle it\u0027s unlikely that the driver can catch the slide in time.

Conversely, grades of more than 8% are discouraged because the road surface is not strong enough to withstand the acceleration forces of heavier vehicles. In this case, the incline might be sealed.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat we might think of as gravel roads are actually three types of road:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EUnformed roads - these are also called earth roads and have a natural alignment on the terrain without any engineering input\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EFormed roads - these have a fairly well defined cross section with some thought to drainage\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EGravelled (or metalled) roads - these are built with specific engineering principals and are constructed with high quality gravel\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen gravel is added back to the road it is called re-sheeting. When the road surface is scraped back to flat it is called grading and it\u0027s graded with a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.ritchiewiki.com\/wiki\/index.php\/Motor_Grader\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Egrader\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUnsealed, gravel roads need to be designed considering the balance of:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Etraffic volumes - i.e. the amount of traffic that will use the road\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Eroad purpose - i.e. will it be heavy milk trucks, or just light vehicles\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Eterrain - how steep do the grades need to be\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Ebudget for maintenance\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Edesign standards.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAustroads (2003) suggests that an average daily traffic level of 150 vehicles or more justifies\u0026nbsp;a single lane gravel road being formed as a two-lane gravel road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt intersections with sealed roads, the seal is usually extended to reduce the amount of gravel introduced onto the seal road, and to make turning off the sealed road onto the gravel road safer.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/driving-in-low-visibility-situations\/\u0022\u003Edriving with limited visibility click here\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E",

This doesn\u0027t have any legal significance, it\u0027s not compulsory you stop on the line or even behind the line, it\u0027s just a guideline. The give way line will be marked where the road is still at least 5m wide, and preferably 6m.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESigns are placed at or before the line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe words ONE LANE BRIDGE are marked on the road.
