You are permitted to drive over this to enter the turning bay and it gives you room to slow down.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERight turn bays reduce the risk of nose-to-tail accidents because turning traffic doesn\u0027t hold up the main traffic flow.

In rural areas this is longer to accommodate more and longer vehicles, and to give a longer area for slowing down - usually 20m minimum as opposed to 10m minimum for urban areas.

Indicate right as you approach the roundabout. Keep indicating right until you pass the exit just before the one you want to take, then indicate left. Exit the roundabout in the appropriate lane (this will sometimes be defined by road markings; other times you will exit into the right lane if it\u0027s a dual carriageway).\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EHow do complex roundabouts work?\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the image below you can see the roundabout at the Greenlane motorway on-ramps and off-ramps. On the west entrance (bottom left) there is a feeder lane onto the motorway on-ramp, and two other lanes. There are two lanes at the exit to the east (top right). At the entrance to the roundabout from the east (top right) there are three lanes of which the right hand one turns right and the other two go straight ahead. There\u0027s also a feeder lane on to the motorway going south.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe motorway off-ramp heading north has two lanes: one has an arrow to the right and the other an arrow to the left. There\u0027s no arrow straight on because that will take you back onto the motorway and it would be highly unusual to do that (i.e. only if you\u0027d made a mistake, in which case you wouldn\u0027t want to confuse other drivers on the roundabout. The same applies at the off-ramp heading south at the top of the picture. Because of these off-ramps, the roundabout is only one lane wide on the east and west, but two lanes wide on the north and three lanes wide on the south.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt position 1 there is a dashed line showing that the inside lane of the two lanes can split into either a third lane which will continue turning right, or the middle lane which will exit onto Greenlane towards the west.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt point 2 you can see that those two lanes exit onto Greenlane to the west and vehicles stay in the respective lanes on the roundabout.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/greenlane-motorway-roundabout.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Roundabout at Greenlane, Auckland\u0022 width=\u0022630\u0022 height=\u0022429\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

If it\u0027s not one-way and it is narrow then you might meet a vehicle coming out of the driveway.

You are permitted to drive over this to enter the turning bay and it gives you room to slow down.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERight turn bays reduce the risk of nose-to-tail accidents because turning traffic doesn\u0027t hold up the main traffic flow. It\u0027s especially useful on rural roads where traffic speeds are higher.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe area where vehicles wait is called the storage bay. In rural areas this is longer to accommodate more and longer vehicles, and to give a longer area for slowing down - usually 20m minimum as opposed to 10m minimum for urban areas. The storage bay is between 3-3.5m wide on rural roads and 2.5-3.5m wide on urban roads with a 3.5m being the desired width for all bays.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThey are marked with white reflectorised lines of 200mm width in rural areas or 150mm width in urban areas, with a white turn arrow in the bay.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERight turning bays are not provided for every single turn off a rural road, just turns where there will be enough traffic to warrant it, or where a turn could be obscured by a corner such as at this intersection on the Coatesville-Riverhead Highway with Sunnyside Rd, north-west of Auckland.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/coatesville-riverhead-turning-bay.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022turning bay on hidden corner\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022459\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EImage is from Google Maps\u003C\/p\u003E",
