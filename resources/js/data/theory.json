If a police officer suspects that the vehicle you are driving might not be roadworthy they will pull you over and conduct a short test, plus check your driver licence and possibly do a breath screening test.

Long projecting loads (particularly very narrow ones) have a small focal point and they are difficult to judge. This means that if the vehicle in front stops, the vehicle behind could run into the load which could act like a spear through the windscreen.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason any load protruding more than one metre behind must carry a flag, as mentioned above. Even protruding wide loads must have a flag.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA narrow load also makes it more difficult for other drivers to pull in behind on a dual carriageway - the load could be small in relation to the vehicle that\u0027s carrying it, and might be mounted high. Other drivers may not be expecting this and our peripheral vision above horizontal is not very good.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAny load hanging over the end of the vehicle will be unsupported and could flex. It also shifts the balance of the vehicle towards the back. In extreme cases this could affect the steering performance of the vehicle, but the load would have to be quite heavy for this to occur.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure any load extending out the back is tied down tightly so that it doesn\u0027t bounce free. Also check that you are not exceeding the maximum 12.6m length for a rigid vehicle.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/overhanging-load.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022Overhanging loads\u0022 width=\u0022402\u0022 height=\u0022178\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETurning arcs\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EA vehicle must not have a load that protrudes too far because there are dangers when turning. The ends of the load will follow a wider arc than the back of the vehicle (and this applies equally to loads that overhang the front, too).

Rural tyre shops also may not carry the full range of tyres that city tyre shops do, and travelling distances will be further. This is why it\u0027s important that you contact a tyre shop as soon as possible to get a replacement tyre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also carry a can of tyre sealant as well as a space saver as you might be able to use this on your original tyre which will give you another 50-80km of travel if you have to travel that kind of distance to get to a tyre shop. Tyre sealant comes in a pressurised can which you connect to the valve of your flat tyre. It inflates the tyre\u0026nbsp;with a foam that temporarily seals the puncture (long enough for you to get to a tyre repair shop).\u003C\/p\u003E",

Put larger, heavier items at the bottom, and arrange items so that they don\u0027t move about when you turn corners, brake or accelerate.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EArrange loads so that they don\u0027t project outside of the body of the vehicle, if possible. Cover them if they will be affected by the wind (see the trailer section below).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EHeavy items such as gas cylinders and tool boxes should be restrained very well, preferably against a cage to stop them moving forward in the event of an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a motorbike\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESmall loads can be carried safely with the proper positioning and fastening. Any heavy items will affect the stability and handling of your motorbike, so it is best to keep these as low as possible especially on lighter bikes.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOf course, your load should not drag on the ground because this can create a hazard for other road users if something breaks off, and it could catch in a groove in the tarmac and flip you off your motorbike.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor lower loads, be careful that they won\u0027t touch the ground when you are leaning over for a corner.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe load must also be secure. Riding with a load balanced on your handlebars is dangerous as it can move around, and you will have less control over the bike because you will need to manage the load. Secure them in saddlebags, tank bags or panniers, or under the seat if you have space there. If you have a small luggage rack on the back of the bike then fasten it with either a strop or elastic cords, but make sure the ends of these don\u0027t hang down and risk getting caught in your wheel or chain as this can lock the wheel causing you to skid.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EKeeping the load central helps with balance. Your load should not extend more than 50cm either side of the centre line of your motorbike. It also must not project more than one metre in front of the front wheel or more than one metre behind the rear wheel.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDistributing the load evenly will help with your balance. Rather than putting the whole load in one saddlebag, divide it in two. If this isn\u0027t possible, you could add extra load to the opposite saddlebag. Carrying an uneven load can cause the bike to pull to one side, and makes it much more difficult to control on bumpy surfaces.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the load whenever you stop to make sure it hasn\u0027t moved.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing a trailer using your motorbike\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you trailer including its load is up to half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed limit is 90kphg. If your trailer including its load is over half the weight of your motorbike the maximum speed is 40kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a light trailer\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELoads in a trailer must be secured and not able to bounce out of the trailer, or fall over the sides. It\u0027s preferable that they are in compartments that are rigidly attached to the trailer. If not, they should be in a cradle or frame designed for the load. If this isn\u0027t possible they should be held in by lashings (webbing, strops, ropes or chains) that are securely fixed to anchor points.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe lashing capacity is half of its breaking strength, e.g. if the breaking strength is 200kg, the lashing capacity is 100kg. The lashing capacity must be at least twice the weight of the load, so you will need to use as many lashings as necessary to achieve this figure.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are carrying a loose load, for example, gravel, then the load must remain 100mm below the edge of the trailer. If the load could be affected by airflow then you will need to cover it with netting or a tarpaulin. The types of loads that might need covering are garden waste, silt, sand, gravel, builders mix, wood chips and general rubbish.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EGoods or animals on your trailer must be placed where they won\u0027t injure anyone or distract you while you are driving.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPosition the load so that the heaviest items are as close to the axle as possible, and balanced. You don\u0027t want to have too much load up the front of the trailer as it puts too much stress on the towball. You also don\u0027t want all the load on the back of the trailer otherwise it tries to lift the towball and this will give you less grip in the rear of your car. You want some downward force on the towball to keep the connection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you remove any of the load part way through the journey you might need to rearrange the goods to rebalance the load. You will need to anticipate whether you should take extra strops or ropes to account for this before you leave.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows an example of how a load, which is flat and resting on the deck of the trailer, can be lifted by the wind.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZIuZ8BUhfew\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022350\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003ETowing capacity\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour vehicle will have a rated towing capacity for an unbraked trailer (usually 750kg) and a trailer with brakes (which could be anything up to 3500kg) depending on the weight of your vehicle, the chassis strength and the power of the brakes.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more information about carrying loads in a trailer read our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022\u003Eguide to towing loads\u003C\/a\u003E, or visit \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ENZTA\u0027s guide to safe towing\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ECarrying loads on a heavy vehicle\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck out our main article about \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/heavy-vehicle-weights-and-loads\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Ecarrying loads in heavy vehicles\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;as there are many more regulations.\u003C\/p\u003E",

They might also conduct the test if you\u0027ve been pulled over for a traffic offence such as speeding or driving inconsiderately.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not a \u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/roadcode-questions\/car\/theory\/warrant-of-fitness-renewal-and-rules\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EWarrant of Fitness\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;test.

If your vehicle is modified and has extra camber, then your tyres can wear on the inside more quickly. Indicator blocks in the tread will show where the tread depth is less than 1.5mm.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThey will check the lights work and aren\u0027t obscured, e.g. not covered by tape.

Cars are not designed for towing. They have towing ability, but it is not their main function, therefore when they are towing a trailer the handling and braking performance is reduced.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reduced speed limit takes into account that the extra weight of a trailer will increase the stopping distance (which is why you should leave a four-second gap to the vehicle in front when towing a trailer).\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe trailer also exerts an extra sideways force on the rear of the car while cornering that can cause the car and trailer to jack-knife in extreme circumstances. There is more risk of this happening when the roads are slippery or if the vehicle is an unladen ute (i.e. the back end of the vehicle is light).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECars and trailers represent a longer vehicle to pass for other road users. There are two opposing arguments here:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Eby restricting the speed you force other motorists to pass, but at least it\u0027s easier for them to pass\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003Eif we didn\u0027t restrict the speed then there wouldn\u0027t be the need to pass, but the risk of accidents would be higher.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAn inadvertent benefit of this is that cars tend to be slightly more economical at 90kph than 100kph so you will enjoy fuel saving at the expense of time savings.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERead our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/towing-a-trailer-the-complete-guide-in-new-zealand\/\u0022\u003Ecomplete guide to towing a trailer\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;for more information.\u003C\/p\u003E",

If you don\u0027t have tyre tread then the tyre will ride up on top of the surface of the water, at which time you lose the majority of your grip. This is called aquaplaning or hydroplaning.

This is a particular problem on motorways and dual carriageways: a vehicle begins\u0026nbsp;to overtake you and, out of the corner of your eye you see the end of it. You take a quick glance in your blind spot and you should be able to see the trailer. Bear in mind the trailer coupling is low down and therefore not as easy to see - in fact, it might be impossible to see if you are a short driver and your car has a high shoulder line. If the trailer is too far behind, motorists may think they can pull in right behind the towing vehicle, but will hit the tow coupling. It\u0027s even more risky if it is a vehicle being towed by a rope.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFour metres also ensures that the trailer can be of usable length without risking that the whole vehicle combination becomes unwieldy or illegally long.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe longer the tow coupling, the greater the potential for flexing of the material if the towing arm is made of metal.
