It could be that the bonnet won\u0027t secure in place, or the catch won\u0027t clip all the way in. In this case, heavy buffeting by wind on the bonnet can flex it enough that it pops the catch open.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason is if the bonnet catch or the surrounding metal has rusted and therefore become weak.

The instant loss of pressure is the first thing that unbalances the vehicle.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBecause there is less rolling resistance on the side of the blowout at the rear of the vehicle, it will first swing that way. But it can\u0027t continue to swing that way forever and eventually it will grip and the forward momentum will swing the back end back the other way, leading to a fishtailing effect. An overcorrection at this point will mean a spin.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the majority of the braking force is transmitted through the front wheels, braking performance won\u0027t be compromised much, but braking heavily could still unbalance the vehicle.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your car is fitted with electronic stability control (ESC), you should be able to apply moderate braking force because the electronics in the car will stabilise the skid and keep you heading straight faster than you can react.

Our ears are at their most sensitive at around 2kHz, therefore the least\u0026nbsp;energy is required by the siren to generate a sound that is the most audible to humans. As well as the oscillating siren which goes up and down in pitch, some emergency vehicles can use short bursts of sound with a broader frequency range. These interrupt the siren and are also better for helping you to spatially locate the siren. This is because sounds between 1-3kHz are quite \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.physics.org\/featuredetail.asp?id=75\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Edifficult to locate spatially\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent countries use different siren sounds.

You may be fined for doing so because you put other road users in danger. The onus is on the emergency vehicle to find a way through. If you can move to the side of the lane without entering the intersection, then do that. Emergency vehicle drivers are trained not to pressurise other drivers where it might cause them to do something illegal or dangerous. On a motorway in stop-start rush hour traffic, they will be far more aggressive at getting vehicles to move than they will be at traffic lights where other vehicles are entering the intersection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should also not drive up on a footpath.

It\u0026rsquo;s manufactured to work within the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s construction to provide protection and added rigidity. If you look closely, you can see some differences. For example, the glass in your rear window will have wires running through it through which a current is passed that heats the glass to evaporate condensation. On some vehicles, the front window has an antenna embedded in it for the radio.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat are the types of automotive glass?\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are three main areas where different types of glass might be used on your vehicle.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EWindscreen\/windshield and sunroof: this uses laminated glass which is very strong\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ESide and rear windows: these use tempered glass\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ELights: glass was used on older vehicles but has been replaced by plastics\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ELaminated glass\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBy law a windscreen must be made of laminated glass and this is usually a sandwich of two 2.1mm layers of glass with a 0.8mm sheet polyvinyl butyral (PVB) in the middle. They are fused together to form a strong, curved sheet which won\u0026rsquo;t shatter into pieces on impact. The film holds the glass together in one sheet, helping prevent shards of glass enter the cabin as they stick to the film. As the plastic sheet is stretchy, it helps absorb any impact, e.g. a deer hitting the windscreen.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe PVB filters out the majority of the sun\u0026rsquo;s UV A and UV B rays (95% or more), helping protect occupants from sunburn as it\u0027s the equivalent of wearing factor 50 sun screen. As the glass is so strong, it helps with structural rigidity. In a rollover crash it will help prevent the roof from buckling downwards.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ETempered glass\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETempered glass is rapidly heated and cooled several times. If broken, it shatters into lots of small pieces that aren\u0026rsquo;t as sharp or likely to cause damage to vehicle occupants in an accident. Tempered glass is strong enough to withstand fairly strong impacts and closing the door hard. It\u0026rsquo;s also safer to have tempered glass on side windows if you end up in a situation such as the vehicle being underwater or in an accident where the doors can\u0026rsquo;t be opened, because the glass can be broken by kicking it.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETempered glass does not block UV rays as well as laminated glass unless it\u0027s been specifically UV-treated. \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/glass-car-windows-doesnt-fully-protect-suns-uv-rays-could-explain-left-side-skin-255398\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003ETypical SPF protection is around 20\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;in glass that is not specifically treated, and around 45 in glass that is.
