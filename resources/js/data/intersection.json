They are less complex than crossroads. T intersections work well in low and medium volumes of traffic but can be difficult to emerge from when turning right if traffic is heavy. When a T-intersection gets busy, or there are a number of accidents, it might have traffic lights installed to control when vehicles can go. Otherwise the intersection might be uncontrolled (no lines), a give way (a white line) or a stop (yellow line).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a stop sign is placed at a T-intersection it is usually because visibility of the road is restricted as you approach it.\u003C\/p\u003E",

This is safer because traffic passing straight through will build up more speed than turning traffic, and any potential conflict of traffic due to inadvertent red light running will be at a slower speed because turning vehicles will have already slowed to make the turn.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s best practice to bring a red turn arrow up at the same time as a full red. If traffic is held back by a right turn arrow, the recommended time is 5 seconds if the arrow is to be extinguished to create a filter turn.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a red arrow protects a pedestrian crossing, the time will be set in accordance with the width of the crossing and the type of users.
