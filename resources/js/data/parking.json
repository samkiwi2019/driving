The reason you would do all of this is that older style handbrakes (which are the first line of resistance, and hold the rear wheels) have a tendency to slightly loosen after being pulled on if the mechanism was hot and then cools, so if you didn\u0027t have the handbrake on hard enough, the vehicle could roll forward in a car with a manual gearbox.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a manual car, putting the car into reverse is the second line of defence because it provides a lot of resistance because the engine will not want to turn over backwards, which is what will happen if the car starts to roll forwards. The opposite is true if you park uphill.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an automatic car, P (park) prevents the car from rolling forward.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows how a mechanical\u0026nbsp;hand brake (or \u0027parking brake\u0027) works.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MqzD5-IRVQQ?rel=0\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022allowfullscreen\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModern cars have hydraulic hand brakes which provide the optimal amount of force.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the car does roll forward, pointing the wheels towards the kerb means that the car will roll into the kerb and, as long as it doesn\u0027t have too much speed, the kerb will stop it.

For example, while you can park 1m away from a driveway, you have to be at least 6m away from an intersection unless there are marked bays or signage saying you can park closer. \u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EParking any closer than six metres starts to significantly restrict visibility especially if the vehicle is an SUV or van which is taller than a car. As vehicles exit the intersection they will have to nose out further to see up the road and this puts them in danger. While some expensive cars have cameras that look up the road, most people will have to get their bonnet into the lane to be able to see, and that means that other vehicles have to swerve around it.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESix metres is a good compromise between using all the available parking and not restricting road users\u0027 visibility. On some intersections this isn\u0027t an issue and you might find marked bays or a parking line closer than six metres to the intersection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EPedestrian crossings\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also must park at least 6m away from a pedestrian crossing - 6m is about 1.5 times the length of a medium-sized car. This is because your vehicle will obscure the view of pedestrians up the road, and obscure the view of the pedestrians from drivers driving towards the crossing.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially important for pedestrians who are visually impaired because drivers need to be able to see them as early as possible, and the pedestrians won\u0027t know that there\u0027s a vehicle blocking the view of the crossing.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERead our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/pedestrian-crossings-and-refuges-sharing-the-roads-with-pedestrians\/\u0022\u003Ecomprehensive guide to pedestrian crossings by clicking here\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EBus stops\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must also park at least 6m from a bus stop marked only by a sign so that the bus will have enough room to pull in and move out again.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EFire hydrants\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a fire hydrant, you mustn\u0027t park closer than 500mm (0.5m) unless someone who can move it stays with the vehicle.

For example, while you can park 1m away from a driveway, you have to be at least 6m away from an intersection unless there are marked bays or signage saying you can park closer. \u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EParking any closer than six metres starts to significantly restrict visibility especially if the vehicle is an SUV or van which is taller than a car. As vehicles exit the intersection they will have to nose out further to see up the road and this puts them in danger. While some expensive cars have cameras that look up the road, most people will have to get their bonnet into the lane to be able to see, and that means that other vehicles have to swerve around it.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESix metres is a good compromise between using all the available parking and not restricting road users\u0027 visibility. On some intersections this isn\u0027t an issue and you might find marked bays or a parking line closer than six metres to the intersection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EPedestrian crossings\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou also must park at least 6m away from a pedestrian crossing - 6m is about 1.5 times the length of a medium-sized car. This is because your vehicle will obscure the view of pedestrians up the road, and obscure the view of the pedestrians from drivers driving towards the crossing.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially important for pedestrians who are visually impaired because drivers need to be able to see them as early as possible, and the pedestrians won\u0027t know that there\u0027s a vehicle blocking the view of the crossing.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERead our \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.drivingtests.co.nz\/resources\/pedestrian-crossings-and-refuges-sharing-the-roads-with-pedestrians\/\u0022\u003Ecomprehensive guide to pedestrian crossings by clicking here\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EBus stops\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must also park at least 6m from a bus stop marked only by a sign so that the bus will have enough room to pull in and move out again.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EFire hydrants\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s a fire hydrant, you mustn\u0027t park closer than 500mm (0.5m) unless someone who can move it stays with the vehicle.

The reason you would do all of this is that older style handbrakes (which are the first line of resistance, and hold the rear wheels) have a tendency to slightly loosen after being pulled on if the mechanism was hot and then cools, so if you didn\u0027t have the handbrake on hard enough, the vehicle could roll forward in a car with a manual gearbox.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a manual car, putting the car into reverse is the second line of defence because it provides a lot of resistance because the engine will not want to turn over backwards, which is what will happen if the car starts to roll forwards. The opposite is true if you park uphill.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an automatic car, P (park) prevents the car from rolling forward.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis video shows how a mechanical\u0026nbsp;hand brake (or \u0027parking brake\u0027) works.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ciframe src=\u0022https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MqzD5-IRVQQ?rel=0\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022allowfullscreen\u0022\u003E\u003C\/iframe\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EModern cars have hydraulic hand brakes which provide the optimal amount of force.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf the car does roll forward, pointing the wheels towards the kerb means that the car will roll into the kerb and, as long as it doesn\u0027t have too much speed, the kerb will stop it.
