                "description": "\u003Ch1\u003EWhat are fog lamps or fog lights?\u003C\/h1\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen you drive in fog or heavy snowfall you must use your dipped headlights and fog lights.\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFog lights consist of one or two bright red rear lights and two low-mounted headlights. In Europe and other countries that adhere to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be fitted with rear fog lights at minimum. They are less common on Japanese and American vehicles.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe intensity of a rear fog lamp is similar to that of a brake light, or stop lamp, and for this reason there is an argument that having two fog lamps is confusing to drivers following because it looks like activated brake lights. Some cars, such as many Peugeot models, have a centre-mounted fog lamp. Many older cars have one single fog lamp in the right-hand rear light with a reversing lamp in the corresponding place in the left-hand light. Newer cars conforming to UN Regulation 48 must have at least a 10cm separation between the closest illuminated edge of any fog light and stop light.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe disadvantage with a single fog lamp is that it is slightly more difficult to perceive the distance you are away from it.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFog lights can be distracting and\/or blinding to other drivers when there is no fog, so it\u0026rsquo;s important to only turn them on when required. It\u0026rsquo;s actually against the law in New Zealand to use your fog lights when it\u0026rsquo;s not either foggy or snowing, or visibility is significantly reduced in some other way, for example by smoke. If it\u0026rsquo;s clear you are not allowed to use fog lights at night, either.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe front-mounted lights are set low and give a short, wide beam of light to help illuminate the way without reflecting a lot of light back at the driver like full-beam headlights would. The centre line of the beam of light emitted from the lamp must be to the left of the centre axis of the vehicle, and they must be permanently dipped.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFront fog lights help the driver see the edge of the road more clearly. They also provide two extra points of light that oncoming drivers can see through the fog. In fact, front-mounted fog lamps must not be positioned higher than dipped-beam headlights on the vehicle.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicles are allowed a maximum of two front fog lights and two rear fog lights in New Zealand. The front ones must be white or amber and the rear ones must be red. There are approved standards that must be met.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ERear fog lights must be able to be turned on and off independently of the taillights.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhat visibility levels should fog lights be used in?\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can find the specifications of fog lamps in \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.nzta.govt.nz\/resources\/rules\/vehicle-lighting-2004\/#102\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Erule 32005 Vehicle Lighting 2004 from the Ministry of Transport\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are no definite directions about when to use fog lights. Road authorities in other countries suggest that a reduction in visibility to less than 100m means visibility is reduced enough to use fog lights, but 100m is difficult to judge when it\u0027s dark. The New Zealand rule specifically states:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFog lamp means a high intensity lamp designed to aid the driver or other road users in conditions of severely reduced visibility, including fog or snow but not including clear atmospheric conditions under the hours of darkness, and that is:\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(a) a front fog lamp; or\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(b) a rear fog lamp.\u003C\/em\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E",

Overtaking is the most risky manoeuvre on the roads because you expose yourself to traffic travelling in the opposite direction, and often higher speeds are involved. Overtaking requires that you make many more judgments about speed, obstacles and risks than regular motoring.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EOvertaking on the right\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you pass on the right you can put your vehicle in danger because you might have to enter a lane or part of the road that\u0026rsquo;s used by oncoming vehicles, you could have to accelerate briskly, you\u0026rsquo;re changing your path of travel and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk that the person you are overtaking hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should only pass if it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to pass. For example, if you are following someone on the open road doing 95kph, is it really necessary to urgently pass just to do 100kph? Impatience with the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re following can cause you to make rash decisions and put yourself in danger.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPassing is relatively straightforward if you follow the rules.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need to prepare to overtake. This means getting your vehicle in a position where the vehicle you are about to overtake, and any vehicles following you, know what your intentions are. This helps prevent a vehicle behind you beginning an overtaking manoeuvre when you are about to pull out to overtake.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThen\u0026nbsp;you need to judge distances. As in the question above, you need to be able to see 100m of clear road ahead of you once you have finished overtaking, so you will need to judge your potential acceleration vs the speed of the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re overtaking.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThen\u0026nbsp;you need to read the road ahead and identify dangers. All kinds of dangers exist such as dips, crests, driveways and so on.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your mirrors to ensure no one else is passing you. If you\u0026rsquo;re sure it\u0026rsquo;s safe to go signal (for 3 seconds) and make your move. Be ready to abort if you assess the situation isn\u0026rsquo;t safe.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ESignal left and pull back into your lane when you can see the vehicle you are overtaking in your rear view mirror. You should have already made sure your rear view mirror is set so that you can see clearly out of your rear window.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0026rsquo;re overtaking a cyclist, motorbiker or horse, leave extra room.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EOvertaking on 3-laned roads\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a road has three lanes with two lanes travelling in the opposite direction, you can overtake if the white line closest to you is broken and there is no traffic coming towards you in the middle lane. If you have a solid yellow or white line, you must not overtake.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/media\/question-images\/passing-on-three-lane.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhen are you allowed to overtake on the left\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou are only allowed to pass on the left when there are two or more lanes on your side of the centre line and the vehicle in the right hand lane is going slower than you, and it is safe to do so (like in the image below); or when a police officer directs you to, or when a vehicle has stopped or slowed down and is signalling a right turn or is making a right turn.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/media\/question-images\/passing-left.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EOvertaking on a yellow line\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow line is a road marking that you must not cross unless directed to do so by police, or you are turning into a driveway.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/no-passing-line.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022no passing line showing dip and crest\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 height=\u0022200\u0022 \/\u003EThe yellow line is called a no-passing line and it\u0026rsquo;s usually there because it\u0026rsquo;s unsafe to cross the centre line. There might be a hidden dip or crest, or a corner that you can\u0026rsquo;t see through. Or, it might have been an accident blackspot in the past and it is safer to not overtake there.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPassing lanes are also marked on three-lane roads so that traffic travelling in the direction with two lanes is not permitted to use the third lane.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENo-passing lines are warned in advanced with a broken yellow line which you can see starts a A. The line begins at C. You must not start to pass on a broken or dashed yellow line, but you can move back into your lane if you are already overtaking.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only time you can overtake when there is a yellow no-passing line is if the lane is wide enough for two vehicles, you can see 100mm of clear road in front of you for the whole time you are passing, and you stay on your side of the yellow line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003ERoad Code theory regarding\u0026nbsp;passing\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore passing, ask yourself is it necessary. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to hang back and wait, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling impatient as this is often when you make poor judgment and have an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore you pass you need to make sure that you can complete your manoeuvre and still see 100 metres of clear road ahead of you. Look as far ahead as possible, check your mirrors, signal for at least three seconds and move out to pass. (Interestingly, the Road Code does not mention that you should check your blind spots, but you should).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore pulling back in front of the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;ve just passed, signal for at least three seconds and check you can see it in your rear view mirror.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are passing a horse, speed can cause the horse to panic. Give it a wide berth and slow down to overtake.

The following is advice provided to police drivers and members of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOvertaking should be seen as a set of hazards that you have to deal with. The main hazard is the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re overtaking, then there are many minor hazards such as the road surface, the weather, vehicles on the side of the road, pedestrians, animals, and so on. These hazards could be difficult to predict, particularly things like a dog running out in front of you, or the vehicle in front hitting a puddle which causes spray that temporarily affects your view of the road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EPreparing to overtake\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overtaking position is a compromise between staying back a safe distance (two or more seconds), and reducing the time it takes to get past the vehicle in front. There\u0026rsquo;s no specific guidelines about how close you should be to the vehicle in front, except that you should be aware that it is more dangerous because your vision is reduced and if it brakes or stops suddenly you may run into the back of it (\u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/tailgating-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-dangerous\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eread our article on tailgating\u003C\/a\u003E for the reasons why). Following another driver closely for too long might cause them to speed up (which will make it more difficult for you to pass), or become angry at your driving, which could lead to a road rage incident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overtaking position lets both drivers following you and the driver in the vehicle ahead of you know that you are preparing to overtake. If you are following a large vehicle such as a truck, a car towing a caravan, or agricultural machinery such as a combine harvester then if you are too close you might be hidden from the driver\u0026rsquo;s view. Make sure you can see their mirrors so that they can see you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the overtaking position you will also be closer to the centre line. Be careful of oncoming traffic, particularly large, wide vehicles, or where the road is narrow or there are other hazards like parked cars on the other side of the road that would mean that oncoming traffic will be closer to the centre line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can see ahead that you can\u0026rsquo;t overtake for some time, drop back again to maintain a safe distance.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EJudging distance\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have completed your overtaking manoeuvre you need to be able to pull back to the left, but have you got enough room? Knowing the performance of your car, bike or truck is essential for being able to judge whether you have enough room to complete the manoeuvre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are overtaking a line of traffic, this is more dangerous as the obstacle is longer and other drivers in the line may pull out to overtake without seeing you. Look for other vehicles beginning to drift towards the centre line even before you see an indicator signal to give you a clue as to a driver\u0026rsquo;s intention, especially if you can see where they are looking and that they have also moved up into an overtaking position. They may be less confident than you, and have therefore waited slightly longer to begin the manoeuvre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis also applies to you: before you make your move, check your mirrors and over your shoulder to ensure another driver hasn\u0026rsquo;t pulled out to pass you. This is less likely to happen if you are clearly signalling your intent, and indicating before you intend to move, but you cannot take it for granted that it won\u0026rsquo;t.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EIdentifying hazards ahead\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELook as far ahead on the road as you can. Are there any side streets, farm gates, driveways or other places vehicles could turn into the road. If there\u0026rsquo;s a right hand turn ahead and you are overtaking a line of traffic, this will be extremely dangerous if one of the vehicles turns right as you are overtaking. It also puts you at risk of a driver turning into your path from a side street without looking.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPay attention to clues that indicate where the road goes beyond where you can see \u0026ndash; the tree line, vehicle lights, lamp posts, etc. New Zealand has a large network of rural roads without streetlights. However, there is often a light at junctions.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELook ahead of the vehicle or vehicles you want to overtake and make sure there is a gap you can pull into. If one vehicle is tailgating another then there might not be the gap to pull in if you need to, or it might be that they are ready to overtake.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EMaking the move\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0026rsquo;ve checked the mirrors, signalled and done a final check over your shoulder. Now you can pull into the right lane. You will have a better view of what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. If you have any doubts about whether to complete the move, it\u0026rsquo;s best to pull back into your lane: it\u0026rsquo;s better that you abort the passing attempt than cause a head on collision as the risks of it causing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a serious, debilitating injury (if not a fatality) are close to 100% at highway speeds.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are overtaking a line of traffic you need to consider it as a number of smaller overtaking moves that might end up being joined together. At each point where you can pull back into the line of traffic evaluate whether you can continue or whether you should rejoin the line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWatch your speed\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETraffic enforcement agencies must set laws such as speed limits, and unfortunately these can\u0026rsquo;t be flexible otherwise they get abused. Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s safest to complete your overtaking move as quickly as possible staying within the limits of your vehicle and your driving ability. However, the law states that you should remain within the speed limit when overtaking, even though this increases your time exposed to danger.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomated speed cameras will not be lenient if you are driving beyond the speed limit while overtaking. Police officers may or may not be lenient depending on the circumstances. Non-emergency services drivers should overtake only when it\u0026rsquo;s safe to overtake by staying within the speed limit.\u003C\/p\u003E",

                "description": "\u003Ch1\u003EWhat is a courtesy crossing?\u003C\/h1\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EA courtesy crossing is\u0026nbsp;a raised crossing in the road that you aren\u0027t required to stop for, but allows for a safer place to stop if pedestrians do want to cross.\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe courtesy crossing can subtly direct pedestrians to attempt to cross in a specific place. In this example in \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.newzealand.com\/sg\/article\/ponsonby\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EThree Lamps, Ponsonby\u003C\/a\u003E, Auckland, the courtesy crossing sits on a section of one-way street. There\u0027s a pedestrian crossing around 50m to the right, and a controlled crossing at the traffic lights around 50m to the left. However, because this area is used by a lot of pedestrians going to the cafes, they tend to want to cross the road where it\u0027s most convenient.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/courtesy-crossing-300x158.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Courtesy crossing, Three Lamps, Ponsonby, Auckland\u0022 width=\u0022300\u0022 height=\u0022158\u0022 align=\u0022left\u0022 \/\u003EYou can see the path is extended towards the crossing rather than accommodating more parking. Pedestrians are almost funneled into this courtesy crossing area rather than randomly crossing anywhere.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe change in the road surface and colour makes drivers aware that this is a place that pedestrians might use to cross. They aren\u0027t obliged to stop for pedestrians, but when vehicles have to stop for the actual pedestrian crossing slightly further up the road, they tend to leave a specific gap across the courtesy crossing for pedestrians to cross.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EVehicles are also reminded on the prominently coloured crossing that the speed limit is 40kph. This isn\u0027t an automatic speed limit at a courtesy crossing, just one that\u0027s specifically imposed on Ponsonby Road. Courtesy crossings might be marked in places where the limit is up to 50kph.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOther courtesy crossings are not so prominent, using grey bricks, paving slabs or tiles.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/pedestrian-crossings-and-refuges-sharing-the-roads-with-pedestrians\u0022\u003EClick here to view our extended guide to pedestrian crossings.\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

The second click are the main headlights. To access full beam headlights you\u0027ll either push the stalk forwards or pull it back. In most modern cars pulling the headlight stalk back flashes the headlights whereas pushing it forward keeps the headlights on. In some older cars, you would pull the headlight stalk back until it clicks a switch, then pull it back again to cancel the full beam headlights.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EWhy do other vehicles\u0027 headlights come on in a tunnel?\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EMany newer cars will have daytime running lights which are on all the time, and some have automatic headlights which detect when it\u0027s dark enough for headlights to be lit.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EReplacing headlight bulbs\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEventually your headlight bulbs will fail and then your vehicle is not up to Warrant of Fitness standard.

For example, if you are carrying a heavy load in the boot, or a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, the back of the vehicle is pushed down which means the front of the vehicle points up. This means your low-beam headlights could become dazzling to other drivers. Self-levelling headlights automatically adjust downwards.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have self-levelling headlights and you are carrying a heavy load or towing a trailer, there will be a dial somewhere on your dashboard where you can angle the lights downwards.\u003C\/p\u003E",

The second click are the main headlights. To access full beam headlights you\u0027ll either push the stalk forwards or pull it back. In most modern cars pulling the headlight stalk back flashes the headlights whereas pushing it forward keeps the headlights on.

For example, if you are carrying a heavy load in the boot, or a pillion passenger on a motorcycle, the back of the vehicle is pushed down which means the front of the vehicle points up.

Indicate right as you approach the roundabout. Keep indicating right until you pass the exit just before the one you want to take, then indicate left.

On the west entrance (bottom left) there is a feeder lane onto the motorway on-ramp, and two other lanes. There are two lanes at the exit to the east (top right). At the entrance to the roundabout from the east (top right) there are three lanes of which the right hand one turns right and the other two go straight ahead. There\u0027s also a feeder lane on to the motorway going south.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe motorway off-ramp heading north has two lanes: one has an arrow to the right and the other an arrow to the left. There\u0027s no arrow straight on because that will take you back onto the motorway and it would be highly unusual to do that (i.e. only if you\u0027d made a mistake, in which case you wouldn\u0027t want to confuse other drivers on the roundabout. The same applies at the off-ramp heading south at the top of the picture. Because of these off-ramps, the roundabout is only one lane wide on the east and west, but two lanes wide on the north and three lanes wide on the south.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt position 1 there is a dashed line showing that the inside lane of the two lanes can split into either a third lane which will continue turning right, or the middle lane which will exit onto Greenlane towards the west.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAt point 2 you can see that those two lanes exit onto Greenlane to the west and vehicles stay in the respective lanes on the roundabout.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/greenlane-motorway-roundabout.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Roundabout at Greenlane, Auckland\u0022 width=\u0022630\u0022 height=\u0022429\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOn multi-lane roundabouts it\u0027s a little more complex.

The approach to the crossing will often have a white diamond if the crossing is slightly obscured - note that that is different to some other countries which have zigzags or other road markings on the approach. There will also be a diamond-shaped yellow sign with a pedestrian crossing symbol.

It would have to hit something enormous and solid to stop - e.g. a large boulder in the road, or another very large vehicle head-on.

As the train approaches it triggers the circuit and the lights and barrier arms are activated as per a predefined interval.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe usual way of activating the lights and barriers is for a small voltage to be applied to the track.

Exhaust gases are the result of this fuel being burnt in the engine. If an engine is tuned well and not using oil, the amount of smoke from the exhaust will be minimal.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen a vehicle is cold you will see vapour coming from the exhaust that disappears once the engine is warm.

In a fuel-injected vehicle problems with a number of parts could cause black smoke: cam sensor, fuel injector, map sensor, ECM computer, fuel pressure regulator, or ignition circuit. It\u0026rsquo;s usually possible to change the spark plugs easily. If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t fix it you might need to see a mechanic.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhite smoke\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf your head gasket is blown or the cylinder head is cracked it will cause white smoke with no real smell. The white smoke is caused by water mixing with the fuel, and can be the result of a leak in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.enginebasics.com\/Engine%20Basics%20Root%20Folder\/Intake%20Manifold.html\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eintake manifold\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;(also called inlet manifold), too.

This should be investigated because it can eventually result in the engine seizing. It can be caused by a number of things such as not changing the oil for a long time, worn rings, a \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.agcoauto.com\/content\/news\/p2_articleid\/197\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eplugged PCV valve\u003C\/a\u003E, fault valve stem seals, too much oil, or transmission fluid being sucked into the intake manifold.

The government has progressively introduced more and more stringent requirements for vehicle emissions to help improve our environment as the number of vehicles on the road increases. Airborne pollutants are particularly problematic when there are light winds as they don\u0027t blow away.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EExhaust gases consist of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water vapour and (if you drive a diesel) oxygen. All these are fairly benign, but it\u0026rsquo;s the trace elements that are the problem. They are nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), hydrocarbons and, if it\u0026rsquo;s a diesel engine, diesel soot and particulate matter.\u003C\/p\u003E",

Overtaking is the most risky manoeuvre on the roads because you expose yourself to traffic travelling in the opposite direction, and often higher speeds are involved. Overtaking requires that you make many more judgments about speed, obstacles and risks than regular motoring.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EOvertaking on the right\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you pass on the right you can put your vehicle in danger because you might have to enter a lane or part of the road that\u0026rsquo;s used by oncoming vehicles, you could have to accelerate briskly, you\u0026rsquo;re changing your path of travel and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk that the person you are overtaking hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should only pass if it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to pass. For example, if you are following someone on the open road doing 95kph, is it really necessary to urgently pass just to do 100kph? Impatience with the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re following can cause you to make rash decisions and put yourself in danger.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPassing is relatively straightforward if you follow the rules.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, you need to prepare to overtake. This means getting your vehicle in a position where the vehicle you are about to overtake, and any vehicles following you, know what your intentions are. This helps prevent a vehicle behind you beginning an overtaking manoeuvre when you are about to pull out to overtake.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThen\u0026nbsp;you need to judge distances. As in the question above, you need to be able to see 100m of clear road ahead of you once you have finished overtaking, so you will need to judge your potential acceleration vs the speed of the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re overtaking.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThen\u0026nbsp;you need to read the road ahead and identify dangers. All kinds of dangers exist such as dips, crests, driveways and so on.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck your mirrors to ensure no one else is passing you. If you\u0026rsquo;re sure it\u0026rsquo;s safe to go signal (for 3 seconds) and make your move.

The following is advice provided to police drivers and members of the Institute of Advanced Motorists.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOvertaking should be seen as a set of hazards that you have to deal with. The main hazard is the vehicle you\u0026rsquo;re overtaking, then there are many minor hazards such as the road surface, the weather, vehicles on the side of the road, pedestrians, animals, and so on. These hazards could be difficult to predict, particularly things like a dog running out in front of you, or the vehicle in front hitting a puddle which causes spray that temporarily affects your view of the road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EPreparing to overtake\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overtaking position is a compromise between staying back a safe distance (two or more seconds), and reducing the time it takes to get past the vehicle in front. There\u0026rsquo;s no specific guidelines about how close you should be to the vehicle in front, except that you should be aware that it is more dangerous because your vision is reduced and if it brakes or stops suddenly you may run into the back of it (\u003Ca href=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/tailgating-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-dangerous\/\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eread our article on tailgating\u003C\/a\u003E for the reasons why). Following another driver closely for too long might cause them to speed up (which will make it more difficult for you to pass), or become angry at your driving, which could lead to a road rage incident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe overtaking position lets both drivers following you and the driver in the vehicle ahead of you know that you are preparing to overtake. If you are following a large vehicle such as a truck, a car towing a caravan, or agricultural machinery such as a combine harvester then if you are too close you might be hidden from the driver\u0026rsquo;s view. Make sure you can see their mirrors so that they can see you.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the overtaking position you will also be closer to the centre line. Be careful of oncoming traffic, particularly large, wide vehicles, or where the road is narrow or there are other hazards like parked cars on the other side of the road that would mean that oncoming traffic will be closer to the centre line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can see ahead that you can\u0026rsquo;t overtake for some time, drop back again to maintain a safe distance.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EJudging distance\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you have completed your overtaking manoeuvre you need to be able to pull back to the left, but have you got enough room? Knowing the performance of your car, bike or truck is essential for being able to judge whether you have enough room to complete the manoeuvre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are overtaking a line of traffic, this is more dangerous as the obstacle is longer and other drivers in the line may pull out to overtake without seeing you. Look for other vehicles beginning to drift towards the centre line even before you see an indicator signal to give you a clue as to a driver\u0026rsquo;s intention, especially if you can see where they are looking and that they have also moved up into an overtaking position. They may be less confident than you, and have therefore waited slightly longer to begin the manoeuvre.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis also applies to you: before you make your move, check your mirrors and over your shoulder to ensure another driver hasn\u0026rsquo;t pulled out to pass you. This is less likely to happen if you are clearly signalling your intent, and indicating before you intend to move, but you cannot take it for granted that it won\u0026rsquo;t.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EIdentifying hazards ahead\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELook as far ahead on the road as you can. Are there any side streets, farm gates, driveways or other places vehicles could turn into the road. If there\u0026rsquo;s a right hand turn ahead and you are overtaking a line of traffic, this will be extremely dangerous if one of the vehicles turns right as you are overtaking. It also puts you at risk of a driver turning into your path from a side street without looking.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EPay attention to clues that indicate where the road goes beyond where you can see \u0026ndash; the tree line, vehicle lights, lamp posts, etc. New Zealand has a large network of rural roads without streetlights. However, there is often a light at junctions.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ELook ahead of the vehicle or vehicles you want to overtake and make sure there is a gap you can pull into. If one vehicle is tailgating another then there might not be the gap to pull in if you need to, or it might be that they are ready to overtake.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EMaking the move\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0026rsquo;ve checked the mirrors, signalled and done a final check over your shoulder. Now you can pull into the right lane. You will have a better view of what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. If you have any doubts about whether to complete the move, it\u0026rsquo;s best to pull back into your lane: it\u0026rsquo;s better that you abort the passing attempt than cause a head on collision as the risks of it causing\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a serious, debilitating injury (if not a fatality) are close to 100% at highway speeds.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you are overtaking a line of traffic you need to consider it as a number of smaller overtaking moves that might end up being joined together. At each point where you can pull back into the line of traffic evaluate whether you can continue or whether you should rejoin the line.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch3\u003EWatch your speed\u003C\/h3\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETraffic enforcement agencies must set laws such as speed limits, and unfortunately these can\u0026rsquo;t be flexible otherwise they get abused. Technically, it\u0026rsquo;s safest to complete your overtaking move as quickly as possible staying within the limits of your vehicle and your driving ability. However, the law states that you should remain within the speed limit when overtaking, even though this increases your time exposed to danger.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAutomated speed cameras will not be lenient if you are driving beyond the speed limit while overtaking. Police officers may or may not be lenient depending on the circumstances. Non-emergency services drivers should overtake only when it\u0026rsquo;s safe to overtake by staying within the speed limit.\u003C\/p\u003E",

                "description": "\u003Ch1\u003EThe legal definition of a road in New Zealand\u003C\/h1\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECar parks, wharves, riverbeds, beaches, road shoulders and bridges are included in the definition of a road.\u003C\/strong\u003E Streets, ways, highways, public highways and public roads are simply words that mean a road of a certain kind.\u0026nbsp;A place to which the public have access, whether as of right or not.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWith them being designated a road it allows NZTA to apply rules to them to keep people safe, restrict certain vehicles and certain usages, and protect certain areas. For example, beaches are specifically included as roads so that speed limits and road worthiness can be enforced.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere can often be some confusion over what people think a \u0027road\u0027 is, and what the actual legal definition of a road is.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe original definition of a road comes from \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.luminarium.org\/encyclopedia\/commonlaw.htm\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003EEnglish common law\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;that was put into practice in New Zealand. A very simple test is used: is there a right of way or right of passage granted to the public by the land owner? It was the permission for public use that was the important part; a legal road could be owned by a private individual but given for use by the public.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe modern definition of \u0027use\u0027 means that the public in general must have access, not just a section of them, and that the road must be being used by the public.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have this rule then you can prevent people from interfering with the rights of road users to use the road and travel from one place to another.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were three types of roads:\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cul\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EFootpaths - only for use by pedestrians\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003EBridleways - for use by pedestrians and animals\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003Cli\u003ECarriageways - for use by pedestrians, animals and vehicles.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\u003C\/ul\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EEven though roads are fairly well defined now, there are still facets of the law that make it difficult to be black and white about what is a road and what isn\u0027t a road in some circumstances. The Acts that define what a road is don\u0027t grant rights of access or passage, they simply seek to define what is allowable should the public have rights of access or passage.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Ch2\u003EDefinition of a road for insurance purposes\u003C\/h2\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYour insurance company might have a completely different definition of what a road is. For example, a specific beach might be a road but if you get your vehicle stuck on it\u0026nbsp;and the tide washes through it writing it off, you might not be insured for a number of reasons (driving off-road, driving recklessly, etc) - insurance companies tend to have a large number of exit clauses. Be sure to check your policy if you want to do any \u0027off-road\u0027 driving, especially if it involves driving through streams or rivers.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe following image shows part of a beach that is being used by vehicles as a road.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/resources\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/beach-road.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022beach road\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022 height=\u0022360\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E",

Our ears are at their most sensitive at around 2kHz, therefore the least\u0026nbsp;energy is required by the siren to generate a sound that is the most audible to humans. As well as the oscillating siren which goes up and down in pitch, some emergency vehicles can use short bursts of sound with a broader frequency range. These interrupt the siren and are also better for helping you to spatially locate the siren. This is because sounds between 1-3kHz are quite \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.physics.org\/featuredetail.asp?id=75\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Edifficult to locate spatially\u003C\/a\u003E.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDifferent countries use different siren sounds.

You may be fined for doing so because you put other road users in danger. The onus is on the emergency vehicle to find a way through. If you can move to the side of the lane without entering the intersection, then do that. Emergency vehicle drivers are trained not to pressurise other drivers where it might cause them to do something illegal or dangerous. On a motorway in stop-start rush hour traffic, they will be far more aggressive at getting vehicles to move than they will be at traffic lights where other vehicles are entering the intersection.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should also not drive up on a footpath.

The blue car has right of way \u0026ndash; the red car must wait for you to turn.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would apply turning out of your own driveway, out of a supermarket car park and so on. Most driveways won\u0027t have signs telling you to give way unless they are used by a lot of traffic or the land owner has decided to erect a sign to remind drivers.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen pulling out of a driveway remember that other vehicles can be parked within 1m of the entrance and that could make it more difficult for you to see up the road.

As you can see in the video below, if you get caught out on the crossing, the train cannot stop quickly.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003ETherefore, as you approach a railway level crossing, check how many lines you will need to cross, and that there is enough room for you to pass over the crossing and leave at least 5 metres behind you (5m is about the length of a large car).\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EBe careful in rush hour because vehicles can be slow moving and stop suddenly. Also be careful where there is an intersection\u0026nbsp;soon after the railway crossing because a large vehicle could stop to turn left (if there are pedestrians crossing) or right (if it has to wait for oncoming traffic) and block the road, causing vehicles to stack up behind it. Crossings where this is a risk often have yellow \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.udel.edu\/artfoundations\/drawing\/crosshatch.html\u0022\u003Ecross-hatches\u003C\/a\u003E\u0026nbsp;on them that warn drivers not to block the lanes.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you do inadvertently become stranded on the lines, you might be able to drive around the barrier to get off the track. If you can\u0027t get off the track, get out of the vehicle and move well out of the way, towards the direction that a train is coming, in case the train hits the vehicle and it ricochets out of the way.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see in this satellite photo of the crossing on Morningside Drive, Auckland, there is a long cross-hatched area (marked in yellow lines) which is the no stopping area across the tracks. To the left in the image there is a left turn immediately after it (McDonald), and a bit further on (out of view) a road to the right. On the right of the image, traffic will queue at the traffic lights onto New North Road. This is one of the most dangerous crossings in Auckland and has seen serious accidents and fatalities.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg

Pay attention to the vehicle\u0027s indicators. Just because it moves out to the right doesn\u0027t mean it is turning right.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you start to overtake the vehicle on the left and it turns in front of you, you are at risk of running into it.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is particularly important for motorcyclists who can squeeze through smaller gaps, but they are at greater risk of falling under a vehicle\u0027s wheels in the event of an accident.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same can happen for right turns. A long vehicle might stay left in order to be able to make a right-hand turn into a driveway or narrow intersection, or at a mini roundabout.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EDrivers are trained to look at their blind spots when making the final turn, but if you are on a cycle or motorbike you might not be visible as large vehicles have large blind spots.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is to do with the circumference of the turn: the vehicle\u0027s front wheels will trace a wider arc than the rear wheels. The rear wheels follow a narrower arc (one with a smaller circumference) so if the vehicle doesn\u0027t pull out wider it risks the rear wheels running over the kerb or hitting road furniture or other vehicles. The amount of space needed to turn is called the \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Turning_radius\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022\u003Eturning radius\u003C\/a\u003E, and the greater the wheelbase and the less the angle of steering, the wider the turning circle.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThe same will apply for cars and motorbikes towing trailers.\u003C\/p\u003E",
